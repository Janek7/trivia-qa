It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south and east of the city. It is also located near Croatia some further 30 km south. Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Latin, Slavic, and Germanic cultures. In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000  and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Province of Trieste.  Trieste was one of the oldest parts of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the 19th century, it was the most important port of one of the Great Powers of Europe. As a prosperous seaport in the Mediterranean region, Trieste became the fourth largest city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (after Vienna, Budapest, and Prague). In the fin-de-siècle period, it emerged as an important hub for literature and music. It underwent an economic revival during the 1930s, and Trieste was an important spot in the struggle between the Eastern and Western blocs after the Second World War. Today, the city is in one of the richest regions of Italy, and has been a great centre for shipping, through its port (Port of Trieste), shipbuilding and financial services.  In 2012, LonelyPlanet.com listed the city of Trieste as the world\\'s most underrated travel destination.   Name  The original pre-Roman name of the city, Tergeste, with the -est- suffix typical of Illyrian, is speculated to be derived from a hypothetical Venetic word *terg- \"market\", etymologically related to Old Church Slavonic \\' \"market\" (whence Slovenian and Serbian trg, tržnica, and the Scandinavian borrowing torg).    Roman authors also transliterated the name as Tergestum. Modern names of the city include: , , , , , , and .  Geography  Trieste lies in the northernmost part of the high Adriatic in northeastern Italy, near the border with Slovenia. The city lies on the Gulf of Trieste.  Built mostly on a hillside that becomes a mountain, Trieste\\'s urban territory lies at the foot of an imposing escarpment that comes down abruptly from the Karst Plateau towards the sea. The karst landforms close to the city reach an elevation of 458 m above sea level.  It lies on the borders of the Italian geographical region, the Balkan Peninsula, and the Mitteleuropa.  Climate  The territory of Trieste is composed of several different climate zones depending on the distance from the sea and elevation. The average temperatures are  in January and  in July.  The climatic setting of the city is  humid subtropical climate (Cfa according to Köppen climate classification) with strong Mediterranean influences. On average, humidity levels are pleasantly low (~65%), while only two months (January & February) receive slightly less than 60 mm of precipitation. Trieste along with the Istrian peninsula enjoys evenly distributed rainfall above 1000 mm in total; it is noteworthy that no true summer drought occurs. Snow occurs on average 0 – 2 days per year. Temperatures are very mild - lows below zero are somewhat rare (with just 9 days per a year) and highs above 30 °C similarly can be expected 15 days a year only. Winter maxima are lower than in typical Mediterranean zone (~ 5 - 11\\xa0°C) with quite high minima (~2 - 8\\xa0°C). Two basic weather patterns interchange - sunny, sometimes windy but often very cold days (max. +7, min. +3; frequently connected to an occurrence of northeast wind called Bora ) and rainy days with temperatures about 6 to. Summer is very warm with maxima about 28 C and lows above 20 C, with the hot nights being influenced by the warm sea water. Absolute maximum of the last fifty years is  in 2003. Absolute minimum is  in 1963. Average year temperature (1971/2000), , is nearly the same as that of Earth.  The Trieste area is divided into 8a-10a zones according to USDA hardiness zoning; Villa Opicina (320 to 420 MSL) with 8a in upper suburban area down to 10a in especially shielded and windproof valleys close to the Adriatic sea.  The climate can be severely affected by the Bora, a very dry and usually cool north-to-northeast katabatic wind that can last for several days and reach speeds of up to 140 km/h, thus sometimes bringing subzero temperatures to the entire city.   City districts   Trieste is administratively divided in seven districts: # Altipiano Ovest: Borgo San Nazario · Contovello (Kontovel) · Prosecco (Prosek) · Santa Croce (Križ) # Altipiano Est: Banne (Bani) · Basovizza (Bazovica) · Gropada (Gropada) · Opicina (Opčine) · Padriciano (Padriče) · Trebiciano (Trebče) # Barcola ()  · Cologna () · Conconello (Ferlugi) · Gretta () · Grignano (Grljan) · Guardiella () · Miramare · Roiano () · Scorcola (Škorklja) # Barriera Nuova · Borgo Giuseppino · Borgo Teresiano · Città Nuova · Città Vecchia · San Vito · San Giusto · Campi Elisi · Sant\\'Andrea · Cavana # Barriera Vecchia (Stara Mitnica) · San Giacomo (Sveti Jakob) · Santa Maria Maddalena Superiore (Sveta Marija Magdalena Zgornja) # Cattinara (Katinara) · Chiadino () · San Luigi · Guardiella (Verdelj) · Longera () · San Giovanni (Sveti Ivan)· Rozzol () · Melara # Chiarbola () · Coloncovez (Kolonkovec) · Santa Maria Maddalena Inferiore () - Raute · Santa Maria Maddalena Superiore () · Servola (Škedenj) · Poggi Paese · Poggi Sant\\'Anna (Sveta Ana)· Valmaura · Altura · Borgo San Sergio  The iconic city center is Piazza Unità d\\'Italia, which is between the large 19th-century avenues and the old medieval city, composed of many narrow and crooked streets.  History     Ancient history    Since the second millennium BC, the location was an inhabited site.  Originally an Illyrian settlement, the Veneti entered the region in the 10th-9th c. BC and seem to have given the town its name, Tergeste, since terg* is a Venetic word meaning market (q.v. Oderzo whose ancient name was Opitergium).  Still later, the town was later captured by the Carni, a tribe of the Eastern Alps, before becoming part of the Roman republic in 177 BC during the Istrian War. Between 52 and 46 BC, it was granted the status of Roman colony under Julius Caesar, who recorded its name as Tergeste in Commentarii de Bello Gallico (51 BC), his work which recounts events of the Gallic Wars.  In imperial times the border of Roman Italy moved from the Timavo river to Formione (today Risano). Roman Tergeste flourished due to its position on the road from Aquileia, the main Roman city in the area, to Istria, and as a port, some ruins of which are still visible.  Emperor Augustus built a line of walls around the city in 33–32 BC, while Trajan built a theatre in the 2nd century.  At the same time, the citizens of the town were enrolled in the tribe Pupinia. In 27 BC, Trieste was incorporated in Regio X of Augustan Italia.   In the early Christian era Trieste continued to flourish.  Between AD 138 and 161, its territory was enlarged and nearby Carni and Catali were granted Roman citizenship by the Roman Senate and Emperor Antoninus Pius at the pleading of a leading Tergestine citizen, the quaestor urbanus, Fabius Severus.  Late Antiquity  The city was witness to the Battle of the Frigidus in Vipava valley in AD 397, in which Theodosius defeated Eugene.  Despite the deposition of Romulus Augustulus at Ravenna in 476 and the ascension to power of Odoacer in Italy, Trieste was retained for a time by the Roman Emperor seated at Constantinople, and thus, became a Byzantine military outpost. In 539, the Byzantines annexed it to the Exarchate of Ravenna and despite Trieste\\'s being briefly taken by the Lombards in 567 in the course of their invasion of northern Italy, held it until the time of the coming of the Franks.  Middle Ages  In 788, Trieste submitted to Charlemagne who placed it under the authority of their count-bishop who in turn was under the Duke of Friùli. From 1081 the city came loosely under the Patriarchate of Aquileia, developing into a free commune by the end of the 12th century.  During the 13th and 14th centuries, Trieste became a maritime trade rival to the Republic of Venice which briefly occupied it in 1283–87, before coming under the patronage of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. After committing a perceived offence against Venice, the Venetian State declared war against Trieste in July 1368 and by November had occupied the city.  Venice intended to keep the city and began rebuilding its defenses, but was forced to leave in 1372. By the Peace of Turin in 1381, Venice renounced its claim to Trieste and the leading citizens of Trieste petitioned Leopold III of Habsburg, Duke of Austria, to make Trieste part of his domains. The agreement of voluntary submission (dedizione) was signed at the castle of Graz on 30 September 1382.   The city maintained a high degree of autonomy under the Habsburgs, but was increasingly losing ground as a trade hub, both at the expense of Venice and the Ragusa (Dubrovnik). In 1463, a number of Istrian communities petitioned Venice to attack Trieste. Trieste was saved from utter ruin by the intervention of Pope Pius II who had previously been bishop of Trieste. However, Venice limited Trieste\\'s territory to 3 mi outside the city. Trieste would be assaulted again in 1468-1469 by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.  His sack of the city is remembered as the \"Destruction of Trieste.\"   Trieste was fortunate to be spared another sack in 1470 by the Ottomans who burned the village of Prosecco, only about   from Trieste, while on their way to attack Friuli.    Early modern period  Following an unsuccessful Habsburg invasion of Venice in the prelude to the 1508–16 War of the League of Cambrai, the Venetians occupied Trieste again in 1508, and were allowed to keep the city under the terms of the peace treaty. However, the Habsburg Empire recovered Trieste a little over one year later, when the conflict resumed. By the 18th century Trieste became an important port and commercial hub for the Austrians. In 1719, it was granted status as a free port within the Habsburg Empire by Emperor Charles VI, and remained a free port until 1 July 1891. The reign of his successor, Maria Theresa of Austria, marked the beginning of a very prosperous era for the city.  19th century  In the following decades, Trieste was briefly occupied by troops of the French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars on several occasions, in 1797, 1805 and 1809. From 1809 to 1813, Trieste was annexed into Illyrian Provinces, interrupting its status of free port and losing its autonomy. The municipal autonomy was not restored after the return of the city to the Austrian Empire in 1813. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Trieste continued to prosper as the Free Imperial City of Trieste (), a status that granted economic freedom, but limited its political self-government. The city\\'s role as Austria\\'s main trading port and shipbuilding centre was later emphasized with the foundation of the merchant shipping line Austrian Lloyd in 1836, whose headquarters stood at the corner of the Piazza Grande and Sanità (today\\'s Piazza Unità d\\'Italia). By 1913 Austrian Lloyd had a fleet of 62 ships comprising a total of 236,000\\xa0tons.  With the introduction of the constitutionalism in the Austrian Empire in 1860, the municipal autonomy of the city was restored, with Trieste becoming capital of the Austrian Littoral crown land ().     In the later part of the 19th century, Pope Leo XIII considered moving his residence to Trieste or Salzburg because of what he considered a hostile anti-Catholic climate in Italy following the 1870 Capture of Rome by the newly established Kingdom of Italy. However, the Austrian monarch, Franz Josef I, rejected the idea.  The modern Austro-Hungarian Navy used Trieste as a base and for shipbuilding. The construction of the first major trunk railway in the Empire, the Vienna-Trieste Austrian Southern Railway, was completed in 1857, a valuable asset for trade and the supply of coal.   In 1882 an Irredentist activist, Guglielmo Oberdan, attempted to assassinate Emperor Franz Joseph, who was visiting Trieste. Oberdan was caught, convicted, and executed. He was regarded as a martyr by radical Irredentists, but as a cowardly villain by the supporters of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Franz Joseph, who reigned another thirty-five years, never visited Trieste again.  20th century  At the beginning of the 20th century, Trieste was a bustling cosmopolitan city frequented by artists and philosophers such as James Joyce, Italo Svevo, Sigmund Freud, Dragotin Kette, Ivan Cankar, Scipio Slataper, and Umberto Saba. The city was the major port on the Austrian Riviera, and perhaps the only real enclave of Mitteleuropa (i.e. Central Europe) south of the Alps. Viennese architecture and coffeehouses dominate the streets of Trieste to this day.  World War I, annexation to Italy and the Fascist era  Italy, in return for entering World War I on the side of the Allied Powers, had been promised substantial territorial gains, which included the former Austrian Littoral and western Inner Carniola. Italy therefore annexed the city of Trieste at the war end, in accordance with the provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London and the Italian-Yugoslav 1920 Treaty of Rapallo. While only a few hundred Italians remained in the newly established South Slavic  state, a population of half a million Slavs,  of which the annexed Slovenes were cut off from the remaining three-quarters of total Slovene population at the time, were subjected to forced Italianization. Trieste had a large Italian majority, but it had more ethnic Slovene inhabitants than even Slovenia\\'s capital of Ljubljana at the end of 19th century.  The Italian lower middle class—who felt most threatened by the city\\'s Slovene middle class—sought to make Trieste a città italianissima, committing a series of attacks led by Black Shirts against Slovene-owned shops, libraries, and lawyers\\' offices, and even the Trieste National Hall, a central building to the Slovene community.  By the mid-1930s several thousand Slovenes, especially members of the middle class and the intelligentsia from Trieste, emigrated to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia or to South America. Among the notable Slovene émigrés from Trieste were the author Vladimir Bartol, the legal theorist Boris Furlan and the Argentine architect Viktor Sulčič. The political leadership of the around 70,000 émigrés from the Julian March in Yugoslavia was mostly composed by Trieste Slovenes: Lavo Čermelj, Josip Vilfan and Ivan Marija Čok. Despite the exodus of the Slovene and German speakers, the city\\'s population increased because of the migration of Italians from other parts of Italy. Several thousand ethnic Italians from Dalmatia also moved to Trieste from the newly created Yugoslavia.   In the late 1920s, resistance began with the Slovene militant anti-fascist organization TIGR, which carried out several bomb attacks in the city centre. In 1930 and 1941, two trials of Slovene activists were held in Trieste by the fascist Special Tribunal for the Security of the State. During the 1920s and 1930s, several monumental building were built in the Fascist architectural style, including the impressive University of Trieste and the almost 70 m tall Victory Lighthouse (Faro della Vittoria), which became a city landmark. The economy improved in the late 1930s, and several large infrastructure projects were carried out.   The Fascist government encouraged some of the artistic and intellectual subcultures that emerged in the 1920s and the city became home to an important avant-garde movement in visual arts, centered around the futurist Tullio Crali and the constructivist Avgust Černigoj. In the same period, Trieste consolidated its role as one of the centres of modern Italian literature, with authors such as Umberto Saba, Biagio Marin, Giani Stuparich, and Salvatore Satta. Intellectuals frequented the historic Caffè San Marco, still open today. Some non-Italian intellectuals remained in the city, such as the Austrian author Julius Kugy, the Slovene writer and poet Stanko Vuk, the lawyer and human rights activist Josip Ferfolja and the anti-fascist clergyman Jakob Ukmar.  The promulgation of the anti-Jewish racial laws in 1938 was a severe blow to the city\\'s Jewish community, at the time the third largest in Italy. The fascist anti-semitic campaign resulted in a series of attacks on Jewish property and individuals, culminating in July 1942 when the Synagogue of Trieste was raided and devastated by the Fascist Squads and the mob.   World War II and aftermath    With the annexation of Province of Ljubljana by Italy and the subsequent deportation of 25,000 Slovenes, which equaled 7.5% of the total population of the Province, the operation, one of the most drastic in Europe, filled up Rab concentration camp, Gonars concentration camp, Monigo (Treviso), Renicci d\\'Anghiari, Chiesanuova, and other Italian concentration camps where altogether 9,000 Slovenes died,  World War II came close to Trieste. Following trisection of Slovenia, starting from the winter of 1941, the first Slovene Partisans appeared in Trieste province although the resistance movement did not become active in the city itself until late 1943.  After the Italian armistice in September 1943, the city was occupied by Wehrmacht troops. Trieste became nominally part of the newly constituted Italian Social Republic, but it was de facto ruled by Germany, who created the Operation Zone of the Adriatic Littoral out of former Italian north-eastern regions, with Trieste as the administrative centre. The new administrative entity was headed by Friedrich Rainer. Under German occupation, the only concentration camp with a crematorium on Italian soil was built in a suburb of Trieste, at the Risiera di San Sabba on 4 April 1944. About 3,000 Jews, South Slavs and Italian anti-Fascists died at the Risiera, while thousands were imprisoned before being transferred to other concentration camps.  The city saw intense Italian and Yugoslav partisan activity and suffered from Allied bombings. The city\\'s Jewish community was deported to extermination camps, where most of them died.  On 30 April 1945, the Italian anti-Fascist National Liberation Committee (Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale, or CLN) of Marzari and Savio Fonda, made up of approximately 3,500 volunteers, incited a riot against the Nazi occupiers. On May 1, Allied members of the Yugoslav Partisans\\' 8th Dalmatian Corps took over most of the city, except for the courts and the castle of San Giusto, where the German garrisons refused to surrender to anyone other than New Zealanders.(The Yugoslavs had a reputation for shooting German and Italian prisoners.) The 2nd New Zealand Division continued to advance towards Trieste along Route 14 around the northern coast of the Adriatic sea and arrived in the city the following day (see official histories The Italian Campaign  and Through the Venetian Line).  The German forces surrendered on the evening of May 2, but were then turned over to the Yugoslav forces.  The Yugoslavs held full control of the city until June 12, a period known in the Italian historiography as the \"forty days of Trieste\".   During this period, hundreds of local Italians and anti-Communist Slovenes were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities, and many of them were never seen again.  These included not only former Fascist and German collaborators, but also Italian nationalists and any other real or potential opponents of Yugoslav Communism. Some were interned in Yugoslav concentration camps (in particular at Borovnica, Slovenia), while others were simply murdered and thrown into potholes (\"foibe\") on the Karst Plateau.  After an agreement between the Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito and the British Field Marshal Harold Alexander, the Yugoslav forces withdrew from Trieste, which came under a joint British-U.S. military administration. The Julian March was divided between Anglo-American and Yugoslav military administration until September 1947 when the Paris Peace Treaty established the Free Territory of Trieste.  Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste (1947–54)  In 1947, Trieste was declared an independent city state under the protection of the United Nations as the Free Territory of Trieste. The territory was divided into two zones, A and B, along the Morgan Line established in 1945.   From 1947 to 1954, the A Zone was governed by the Allied Military Government, composed of the American \"Trieste United States Troops\" (TRUST), commanded by Major General Bryant E. Moore, the commanding general of the American 88th Infantry Division, and the \"British Element Trieste Forces\" (BETFOR),  commanded by Sir Terence Airey, who were the joint forces commander and also the military governors. Zone A covered almost the same area of the current Italian Province of Trieste, except for four small villages south of Muggia, which were given to Yugoslavia after the dissolution (see London Memorandum of 1954) of the Free Territory in 1954. Zone B, which was under the administration of Miloš Stamatović, then colonel of the Yugoslav People\\'s Army, was composed of the north-westernmost portion of the Istrian peninsula, between the river Mirna and the Debeli Rtič cape.  In 1954, in accordance with the Memorandum of London the vast majority of Zone A, including the city of Trieste, was given as civil administration to Italy. Zone B was given as a civil administration to Yugoslavia along with four villages from Zone A (Plavje, Spodnje Škofije, Hrvatini, and Jelarji), and was divided among the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and Croatia.  The final border line with Yugoslavia, and the status of the ethnic minorities in the areas, was settled bilaterally in 1975 with the Treaty of Osimo. This line now constitutes the border between Italy and Slovenia.  Economy  During the Austro-Hungarian era, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth-largest and most important centre in the empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. The economy of Trieste, however, fell into a decline after the city\\'s annexation to Italy after World War I. But Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries (like the famous \"Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)\").  Allied bombings during World War II destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards). As a consequence, Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War. However, since the 1970s, Trieste has experienced a certain economic revival.  Today, Trieste is a lively and cosmopolitan city, with about 8% of its population hailing from a cultural community, and is a major centre in the EU for trade, politics, culture, shipbuilding, education, transport and commerce. The city is part of the Corridor 5 project to establish closer transport connections between Western and Eastern Europe, via countries such as Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Ukraine and Bosnia.   The Port of Trieste is a trade hub with a significant commercial shipping business, busy container and oil terminals, and steel works. The oil terminal feeds the Transalpine Pipeline which covers 40% of Germany\\'s energy requirements (100% of the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg), 90% of Austria and more than 30% of the Czech Republic\\'s.  The sea highway connecting the ports of Trieste and Istanbul is one of the busiest RO/RO [roll on roll-off] routes in the Mediterranean.The port is also Italy\\'s and the Mediterranean\\'s (and one of Europe\\'s) greatest coffee ports, supplying more than 40% of Italy\\'s coffee.  The thriving coffee industry in Trieste began under Austria-Hungary, with the Austro-Hungarian government even awarding tax-free status to the city in order to encourage more commerce. Some remnants of Austria-Hungary\\'s coffee-driven economic ambition remain, such as the Hausbrandt Trieste coffee company. As a result, present-day Trieste boasts many cafes, and is still known to this day as \"the coffee capital of Italy\". Companies active in the coffee sector have given birth to the Trieste Coffee Cluster as their main  umbrella organization, but also as an economic actor in its own right.   Two Fortune Global 500 companies have their global or national headquarters in the city, respectively:  Assicurazioni Generali (BIT: G) and Allianz (BIT: ALV). Other megacompanies based in Trieste are Fincantieri (BIT: FCT), one of the world\\'s leading shipbuilding companies and the Italian operations of Wärtsilä. Prominent companies from Trieste include: AcegasApsAmga (Hera Group), Autamarocchi SpA, Banca Generali SpA (BIT: BGN), Genertel, Genertellife, HERA Trading, Illy, Italia Marittima, Modiano Playing Cards, Nuovo Arsenale Cartubi Srl, Jindal Steel and Power Italia SpA; Pacorini SpA, Siderurgica Triestina (Arvedi Group), TBS Group (BIT: TBS), Telit (AIM: TCM), and polling and marketing company SWG. With a dynamic banking institution, the Zadružna Kraška Banka (ZKB), the local Slovene community contributes vigorously to the economy.  Demographics  , there were 204,849 people residing in Trieste, located in the province of Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, of whom 46.7% were male and 53.3% were female. Trieste had lost roughly ⅓ of its population since the 1970s, due to the crisis of the historical industrial sectors of steel and shipbuilding, a dramatic drop in fertility rates and fast population aging. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totalled 13.78% of the population compared to pensioners who number 27.9%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Trieste residents is 46 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Trieste declined by 3.5%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. However, in the last two years the city has shown signs of stabilizing thanks to growing immigration fluxes. The crude birth rate in Trieste is only 7.63 per 1,000, one of the lowest in eastern Italy, while the Italian average is 9.45 births.   Since the annexation to Italy after World War I, there has been a steady decline in the Trieste\\'s demographic weight compared to other cities. In 1911, Trieste was the 4th largest city in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (3rd largest in the Austrian part of the Monarchy). In 1921, Trieste was the 8th largest city in the country,  in 1961 the 12th largest,  in 1981 the 14th largest,  while in 2011 it dropped to the 15th place.  Language  The particular Friulian dialect, called Tergestino, spoken until the beginning of the 19th century, was gradually overcome by the Triestine dialect of Venetian (a language deriving directly from Vulgar Latin) and other languages, including standard Italian, Slovene, and German. While Triestine and Italian were spoken by the largest part of the population, German was the language of the Austrian bureaucracy and Slovene was predominantly spoken in the surrounding villages. From the last decades of the 19th century, the number of speakers of Slovene grew steadily, reaching 25% of the overall population of Trieste municipality in 1911 (30% of the Austro-Hungarian citizens in Trieste).   According to the 1911 census, the proportion of Slovene speakers amounted to 12.6% in the city centre (15.9% counting only Austrian citizens), 47.6% in the suburbs (53% counting only Austrian citizens), and 90.5% in the surroundings.  They were the largest ethnic group in 9 of the 19 urban neighbourhoods of Trieste, and represented a majority in 7 of them. The Italian speakers, on the other hand, made up 60.1% of the population in the city center, 38.1% in the suburbs, and 6.0% in the surroundings. They were the largest linguistic group in 10 of the 19 urban neighbourhoods, and represented the majority in 7 of them (including all 6 in the city centre). Of the 11 villages included within the city limits, the Slovene speakers had an overwhelming majority in 10, and the German speakers in one (Miramare).  German speakers amounted to 5% of the city\\'s population, with the highest proportions in the city centre. A small proportion of Trieste\\'s population spoke Croatian (about 1.3% in 1911), and the city also had several other smaller ethnic communities, including Czechs, Istro-Romanians, Serbs, and Greeks, who mostly assimilated either into the Italian or the Slovene-speaking communities.  Today, the dominant local dialect of Trieste is Triestine (\"Triestin\", pronounced), influenced by a form of Venetian. This dialect and the official Italian language are spoken in the city, while Slovene  is spoken in some of the immediate suburbs. There are also small numbers of Serbian,  Croatian, German, and Hungarian speakers.   An estimated 19% of the province\\'s population (49,000 out of 260,000 from the last census) belong to the autochthonous Slovene language community. In total, the city\\'s ethnic Slavic minority makes up about 30 percent of the population.   At the end of 2012, ISTAT estimated that there were 16,279 foreign-born residents in Trieste, representing 7.7% of the total city population. The largest autochthonous minority are Slovenes,  but there is also a large immigrant group from Balkan nations (particularly nearby Serbia, Albania and Romania): 4.95%, Asia: 0.52%, and sub-saharan Africa: 0.2%. Serbian community consists of both autochthonous  and immigrant groups.  Trieste is predominantly Roman Catholic, but also has large numbers of Orthodox Christians, mainly Serbs, due to the city\\'s large migrant population from Eastern Europe and its Balkan influence.   Main sights  Castles  Castello Miramare (Miramare Castle)  The Castello Miramare, or Miramare Castle, on the waterfront 8 km from Trieste, was built between 1856 and 1860 from a project by Carl Junker working under Archduke Maximilian. The Castle gardens provide a setting of beauty with a variety of trees, chosen by and planted on the orders of Maximilian, that today make a remarkable collection. Features of particular attraction in the gardens include two ponds, one noted for its swans and the other for lotus flowers, the Castle annexe (\"Castelletto\"), a bronze statue of Maximilian, and a small chapel where is kept a cross made from the remains of the \"Novara\", the flagship on which Maximilian, brother of Emperor Franz Josef, set sail to become Emperor of Mexico. Much later, the castle was also the home of Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, the last commander of Italian forces in East Africa during the Second World War. During the period of the application of the Instrument for the Provisional Regime of the Free Territory of Trieste, as establish in the Treaty of Peace with Italy (Paris 10/02/1947), the castle served as headquarters for the United States Army\\'s TRUST force.  Castel San Giusto (Castle of San Giusto)  The Castel San Giusto, or Castle of San Giusto, was designed on the remains of previous castles on the site, and took almost two centuries to build. The stages of the development of the Castle\\'s defensive structures are marked by the central part built under Frederick III (1470-1), the round Venetian bastion (1508-9), the Hoyos-Lalio bastion and the Pomis, or \"Bastione fiorito\" dated 1630.   Places of worship  * The St. Justus Cathedral. Symbol of Italian Trieste during the Risorgimento. Named after the city\\'s Patron, St. Justus. This church dates back to 1320: its interiors are decorated by beautiful Byzantine mosaics. * The Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity and St. Spyridon (1869). The building adopts the Greek-cross plan with five cupolas in the Byzantine tradition.  * The Anglican Chiesa di Cristo (Christ Church) (1829) * The Waldensian and Helvetian Evangelical Basilica of St. Silvester (11th century) * The Church of Santa Maria Maggiore (1682) * The Augustan Evangelical-Lutheran Church (1874) * The Greek Orthodox Church of San Nicolò dei Greci (1787). This church by the architect Matteo Pertsch (1818), with bell towers on both sides of the façade, follows the Austrian late baroque style. The interiors are full of golden ornaments. * The Synagogue of Trieste (1912). This synagogue is the second-largest in Europe. * The Temple of Monte Grisa (1960)  Archaeological remains  * Arch of Riccardo (33 BC). It is a Roman gate built in the Roman walls in 33. It stands in Piazzetta Barbacan, in the narrow streets of the old town. It\\'s called Arco di Riccardo (\"Richard\\'s Arch\"), where Riccardo is a corruption of \"Cardus\", the Roman street which crossed it. Folk etimology created a local legend, which says that it was crossed by King Richard of England on the way back from the Crusades. * Basilica Forense (2nd century) * Palaeochristian basilica * Roman Age Temples\" : one dedicated to Athena, one to Zeus, both on the S.Giusto hill. The ruins of the temple dedicated to Zeus are next to the Forum, those of Athena\\'s temple are under the basilica, visitors can see its basement.  Roman theatre  The Roman theatre lies at the foot of the San Giusto hill, facing the sea. The construction partially exploits the gentle slope of the hill, and much of the theatre is made of stone. The topmost portion of the steps and the stage were supposedly made of wood.  The statues that adorned the theatre, brought to light in the 1930s, are now preserved at the Town Museum. Three inscriptions from the Trajanic period mention a certain Q. Petronius Modestus, someone closely connected to the development of the theatre, which was erected during the second half of the 1st century.  Caves  In the entire Province of Trieste, there are 10 speleological groups out of 24 in the whole Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. The Trieste plateau (Altopiano Triestino), called Kras or the Carso and covering an area of about 200 km2 within Italy has approximately 1,500 caves of various sizes (like that of Basovizza, now a monument to the Foibe massacres).  Among the most famous are the Grotta Gigante, the largest tourist cave in the world, with a single cavity large enough to contain St Peter\\'s in Rome, and the Cave of Trebiciano, 350 m deep, at the bottom of which flows the Timavo River. This river dives underground at Škocjan Caves in Slovenia (they are on UNESCO list and only a few kilometres from Trieste) and flows about 30 km before emerging about 1 km from the sea in a series of springs near Duino, reputed by the Romans to be an entrance to Hades (\"the world of the dead\").  Others  * The Austrian Quarter - Half of the city was built under Austro-Hungarian dominion, so there is present a very large number of avenues and palaces that resemble Vienna. The most present architecture styles are Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Eclectic, Liberty and Baroque. * Città Vecchia (Old City) - Trieste boasts an extensive old city: there are many narrow and crooked streets with typical medieval houses. Nearly the entire area is closed to traffic. * Piazza Unità d\\'Italia, Trieste\\'s central majestic square surrounded by 19th century architecture, and the largest seafront square in Europe. * Val Rosandra, a national park on the border between the Province of Trieste and Slovenia. * Caffè San Marco, historical cafè in the center of the city. Cafès play an important role in the Triestine economy, as Trieste developed a thriving coffee industry under Austria-Hungary, and is still known to this day as \"the coffee capital of Italy\".  Culture  Trieste has a lively cultural scene with various theatres. Among these are the Opera Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi, Politeama Rossetti, the Teatro La Contrada, the Slovene theatre in Trieste (, since 1902), Teatro Miela, and a several smaller ones.  There are also numerous museums. Among these are: * Diego de Henriquez war museum  * Museo Sartorio   * Revoltella Museum modern art gallery * Civico Museo di Storia Naturale di Trieste (natural history museum) containing fossils of early man. * Civico Orto Botanico di Trieste, a municipal botanical garden * Orto Botanico dell\\'Università di Trieste, the University of Trieste\\'s botanical garden  Two important national monuments: * The Risiera di San Sabba (Risiera di San Sabba Museum), a National monument. It was the only Nazi concentration camp with crematorium in Italy. * The Foiba di Basovizza, a National monument. It is a reminder of the killings of Italians (and other ethnic groups) by Yugoslav partisans after World War II, the last episode of an interethnic violence begun in the 19th century, with the rise of nationalism, and heavily intensified by the Fascist government.  The Slovenska gospodarsko-kulturna zveza - Unione Economica-Culturale Slovena is the umbrella organization bringing  together cultural and economic associations belonging to the  Slovene minority.

It currently has about 23,000 students enrolled and 1,000 professors. Trieste also hosts the Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA), a leading graduate and postgraduate teaching and research institution in the study of mathematics, theoretical physics, and neuroscience, and the MIB School of Management Trieste, a private, ASFOR accredited business school offering one  of the [http://www.eduniversal-ranking.com/business-school-university-ranking-in-italy.html top-five MBA programs] in Italy.  There are three international schools offering primary and secondary education programs in English in the greater metropolitan area: the International School of Trieste, the European School of Trieste, and the United World College of the Adriatic. Liceo scientifico statale \"France Prešeren\" offers public secondary education in the Slovene language.[http://www.preseren.it]  The city also hosts numerous national and international scientific research institutions. Among these: AREA Science Park, which comprises ELETTRA, a synchrotron particle accelerator with free-electron laser capabilities for research and industrial applications; the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, which operates under a tripartite agreement among the Italian Government, UNESCO, and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); the Trieste Astronomical Observatory; the Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS), which carries out research on oceans and geophysics; the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, a United Nations centre of excellence for research and training in genetic engineering and biotechnology for the benefit of developing countries; ICS-UNIDO, a UNIDO research centre in the areas of renewable energies, biofuels, medicinal plants, food safety and sustainable development; the Carso Center for Advanced Research in Space Optics; and the secretariats of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and of the InterAcademy Panel: The Global Network of Science Academies (IAP).  Sports  The local calcio (football) club in Trieste is Triestina, one of the oldest clubs in Italy. Notably, Triestina was runner-up in the 1947/1948 season of the Italian first division (Serie A), losing the championship to Torino.  Trieste is notable for having had two football clubs participating in the championships of two different nations at the same time during the period of the Free Territory of Trieste, due to the schism within the city and region created by the post-war demarcation. Triestina played in the Italian first division (Serie A). Although it faced relegation after the first season after the Second World War, the FIGC changed the rules to keep it in, as it was seen as important to keep a club of the city in the Italian league, while Yugoslavia had its eye on the city. In the championship of next season the club played its best season with a 3rd-place finish. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia bought A.S.D. Ponziana, a small team in Trieste, which under a new name, Amatori Ponziana Trst, played in the Yugoslavian league for 3 years.  Triestina went bankrupt in the 1990s, but after being re-founded regained a position in the Italian second division (Serie B) in 2002. Ponziana was renamed as \"Circolo Sportivo Ponziana 1912\" and currently plays in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Group of Promozione, which is 7th level of the Italian league.  Trieste also boasts a famous basketball team, Pallacanestro Trieste, which reached its zenith in the 1990s when, with large financial backing from sponsors Stefanel, it was able to sign players such as Dejan Bodiroga, Fernando Gentile and Gregor Fučka, all stars of European basketball.  Many sailing clubs have roots in the city which contribute to Trieste\\'s strong tradition in that sport. The Barcolana regatta, which had its first edition in 1969, is the world\\'s largest sailing race by number of participants.  Local sporting facilities include the Stadio Nereo Rocco, a UEFA-certified stadium with seating capacity of 32,500; the Palatrieste, an indoor sporting arena sitting 8,000 people, and Piscina Bruno Bianchi, a large olympic size swimming pool.  Film  Trieste has been portrayed on screen a number of times, with films often shot on location in the area. In 1942 the early neorealist Alfa Tau! was filmed partly in the city.  Cinematic interest in Trieste peaked during the height of the \"Free Territory\" era between 1947 and 1954 with international films such as Sleeping Car to Trieste and Diplomatic Courier portraying it as a hotbed of espionage. These conveyed an impression of the city as a cosmopolitan place of conflict between Great Powers, a portrayal which resembled that of Casablanca (1943). Italian filmmakers, by contrast, portrayed Trieste as unquestionably Italian in a series of patriotic films including Trieste mia! and Ombre su Trieste.   The city hosted in 1963 the first International Festival of Science Fiction Film (Festival internazionale del film di fantascienza), which ran until 1982. Under the name Science Plus Fiction, the festival was brought back in 2000.    Transport  Maritime transport  Trieste\\'s maritime location and its former long term status as part of the Austrian and, between 1867-1918, Austro-Hungarian empires made the Port of Trieste the major commercial port for much of the landlocked areas of central Europe. In the 19th century, a new port district known as the Porto Nuovo was built northeast to the city centre.  There is significant commercial shipping to the container terminal, steel works and oil terminal, all located to the south of the city centre. After many years of stagnation, a change in the leadership placed the port on a steady growth path, recording a 40% increase in shipping traffic .  Rail transport  Railways came early to Trieste, due to the importance of its port and the need to transport people and goods inland. The first railroad line to reach Trieste was the Südbahn, launched by the Austrian government in 1857. This railway stretches for 1400 km to Lviv, Ukraine, via Ljubljana, Slovenia; Sopron, Hungary; Vienna, Austria; and Kraków, Poland, crossing the backbone of the Alps mountains through the Semmering Pass near Graz. It approaches Trieste through the village of Villa Opicina, a few kilometres from the big city but over 300 m higher in elevation. Due to this, the line takes a 32 km detour to the north, gradually descending before terminating at the Trieste Centrale railway station.  A second trans-Alpine railway was dedicated in 1906, with the opening of the Transalpina Railway from Vienna, Austria via Jesenice and Nova Gorica. This railway also approached Trieste via Villa Opicina, but it took a rather shorter loop southwards towards Trieste\\'s other main railway station, the , south of the central station. This line no longer operates, and the Campo Marzio station is now a railway museum.  To facilitate freight traffic between the two stations and the nearby dock areas, a temporary railway line known as the Rivabahn was built along the waterfront in 1887.  This railway survived until 1981, when it was replaced by the Galleria di Circonvallazione, a  railway tunnel route, to the east of the city. Freight services from the dock area include container services to northern Italy and to Budapest, Hungary, together with rolling highway services to Salzburg, Austria and Frankfurt, Germany.  Passenger rail service to Trieste mostly consists of trains to and from Venice, connecting there with high-speed trains to Rome and Milan at Mestre. There are also direct trains to Verona, Turin, Milan, Rome, Florence, Naples and Bologna. These trains reach the Trieste central station bypassing the Gulf of Trieste, connecting with the Südbahn\\'s northern loop. , there are no passenger trains between Italy and Slovenia.  Trieste could in the remote future be connected to the Italian TAV railway network: a 300 km/h fast train route would possibly connect Trieste with Venice. However, this project will not be completed earlier than 2020.  Air transport  Trieste is served by the Friuli Venezia Giulia Airport (IATA code: TRS), located 30 minutes away from the city, at Ronchi near Monfalcone at the head of the Gulf of Trieste. There are many national and international destinations available.  Local transport  Local public transport is operated by Trieste Trasporti, which operates a network of around 60 bus routes and two boat services. They also operate the Opicina Tramway, a hybrid between tramway and funicular railway providing a more direct link between the city centre and Opicina.  Notable people  International relations  Trieste hosts the Secretariat of the Central European Initiative, an intergovernmental organization among Central and South-Eastern European states.  In recent years, Trieste was chosen to host a number of high level bilateral and multilateral meetings such as: the Italo-Russian Bilateral Summit in 2013 (Letta-Putin) and the Italo-German Bilateral Summit in 2008 (Berlusconi-Merkel);  the G8 meetings of Foreign Affairs and Environment  Ministers respectively in 2009 and 2001.

Within China, there may be a regional distinction with the zodiacal yáng more likely to be thought of as a goat in the south, while tending to be thought of as a sheep in the north.   Characteristics  The Chinese commonly regard sheep as an auspicious animal, and the Year of the sheep, therefore, heralds a year of promise and prosperity.  \"Yáng\" (羊) is a component of another written Chinese character \"xiang\" (祥), which means auspiciousness, and the two were interchangeable in ancient Chinese, according to one source.   It is also a part of the character \"shan\" (善), which counts kindness and benevolence as among its meanings.  Individuals born in this zodiac year have been supposed to share certain characteristics with other individuals also born in years of the same animal sign. Similarly, years sharing the same animal sign have been supposed to share certain characteristics, repeating over their 12/60 year cycle. The shared characteristics in this case are traits attributed to goats.  Due to the luni-solar nature of the traditional Chinese calendar system,  the \"zodiacal\" year does not align with the Western calendar: new years are determined by a system which results in each new year beginning on a new moon sometime between late January to mid-to-late February. Goat aspects can also enter by other chronomantic factors or measures, such as hourly.  In Chinese astrology Goats are described as peace-loving and \"kind\" and \"popular\".  With the addition of the wood element, the Goat characteristic is thought to love peace and to be helpful and trusting, but yet also to be \"clinging\" and of a nature resistant to change.

He is also known as a prophet and is mentioned in the second chapter of the Qur\\'an, although not by name.   His status, as viewed by rabbinical literature, is that he was the last of the Hebrew Judges and the first of the major prophets who began to prophesy inside the Land of Israel. He was thus at the cusp between two eras. According to the text of the Books of Samuel, he also anointed the first two kings of the Kingdom of Israel: Saul and David.  Biblical account  Family  Samuel\\'s mother was Hannah and his father was Elkanah. Elkanah lived at Rama-thaim in the district of Zuph.[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2015/08/20/102349-prophet-samuel \"Prophet Samuel\" Orthodox Church in America] His genealogy is also found in a pedigree of the Kohathites (1 Chron. 6:3-15) and in that of Heman, his great-grandson (ib. vi. 18-22). According to the genealogical tables, Elkanah was a Levite - a fact otherwise not mentioned in the books of Samuel. The fact that Elkanah, a Levite, was denominated an Ephraimite is analogous to the designation of a Levite belonging to Judah (Judges 17:7, for example).   According to 1 Samuel: 1-28, Elkanah had two wives, Peninnah and Hannah. Peninnah had children; Hannah did not. Nonetheless, Elkanah favored Hannah. Jealous, Penninah reproached Hannah for her lack of children, causing Hannah much heartache. The relationship of Penninah and Hannah recalls that between Hagar and Sarah.[https://books.google.com/books?id Nj-AkOJ9wRQC&pgPA271&dq prophet+samuel+bible&hlen&sa X&eivP2OVfn8E9GXygTm_J_gAw&ved 0CFIQ6AEwCQ#vonepage&q prophet%20samuel%20bible&ffalse Bergant, Dianne. The Collegeville Bible Commentary Based on the New American Bible, Liturgical Press, 1992, ISBN 9780814622100] Elkanah was a devout man and would periodically take his family on pilgrimage to the holy site of Shiloh. The motif of Elkanah and Hannah as devout, childless parents will reoccur with Zachariah and Elizabeth and the birth of John the Baptist, and with Joachim and Anna and the birth of Mary.  On one occasion Hannah went to the sanctuary and prayed for a child. In tears, she vowed that were she granted a child, she would dedicate him to God as a Nazirite. Eli who was sitting at the foot of the doorpost in the sanctuary at Shiloh, saw her apparently mumbling to herself and thought she was drunk, but is soon assured of her motivation and sobriety. Eli was the priest of Shiloh, and one of the last Israelite Judges before the rule of kings in ancient Israel. He had assumed the leadership after Samson\\'s death.[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/463969/jewish/Samuel-the-Prophet.htm \"Samuel the Prophet\", Chabad.org] Eli blessed her and she returned home. Subsequently Hannah becomes pregnant; her child was Samuel. Hannah\\'s exultant hymn of thanksgiving resembles in several points Mary\\'s later Magnificat.[https://books.google.com/books?id 2Vo-11umIZQC&pgPA213&dq prophet+samuel+bible&hlen&sa X&eiWhuPVf_NAtijyASCxAk&ved 0CFoQ6AEwCTgK#vonepage&q prophet%20samuel%20bible&f=false Dunn, James D.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2003, ISBN 9780802837110]  After the child was weaned, she left him in Eli\\'s care, and from time to time she would come to visit her son.  Name  According to , Hannah named Samuel to commemorate her prayer to God for a child. Samuel is translated as heard of God or \"God has heard\" (from \\'shama\\', \"heard,\" and \\'El\\', God).[http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=samuel Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Samuel] The Hebrew root of \"Samuel\" is \"sha’al\", a word mentioned seven times in 1 Samuel 1 and once as \"sha’ul\", Saul’s name in Hebrew (1 Samuel 1:28). Biblical historian Michael Coogan suggests that Saul’s birth narrative was transferred to Samuel by the Deuteronomist historians.   Calling  One night, Samuel heard a voice calling his name. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Samuel was about 12 years old.  He initially assumed it was coming from Eli and went to Eli to ask what he wanted. Eli, however, sent Samuel back to sleep. After this happened three times Eli realized that the voice was the Lord\\'s, and instructed Samuel on how to answer. Once Samuel responded, the Lord told him that the wickedness of the sons of Eli had resulted in their dynasty being condemned to destruction. In the morning, Eli asked Samuel to honestly recount to him what he had been told by the Lord. Upon receiving the communication, Eli merely said that the Lord should do what seems right unto him.  Leader  During Samuel\\'s youth at Shiloh, the Philistines inflicted a decisive defeat against the Israelites at Eben-Ezer, placed the land under Philistine control, and took the sanctuary\\'s Ark for themselves. Upon hearing the news of the capture of the Ark of the Covenant, and the death of his sons, Eli collapsed and died. When the Philistines had been in possession of the Ark for seven months and had been visited with calamities and misfortunes, they decided to return the Ark to the Israelites.  According to Bruce C. Birch, Samuel was a key figure in keeping the Israelites religious heritage and identity alive during Israel\\'s defeat and occupation by the Philistines. \"[I]t may have been possible and necessary for Samuel to exercise authority in roles that would normally not converge in a single individual (priest, prophet, judge).\"[https://books.google.com/books?id P9sYIRXZZ2MC&pgPA1162&dq prophet+samuel+bible&hlen&sa X&eivP2OVfn8E9GXygTm_J_gAw&ved 0CEQQ6AEwBw#vonepage&q prophet%20samuel%20bible&f=false Birch, Bruce C., \"Samuel\", Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, (David Noel Freedman, Allen C. Myers, and Astrid B. Beck, eds.), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, ISBN 9780802824004]  After 20 years of oppression, Samuel, who had gained national prominence as a prophet (1 Samuel 3:20), summoned the people to the hill of Mizpah, and led them against the Philistines. The Philistines, having marched to Mizpah to attack the newly amassed Israelite army, were soundly defeated and fled in terror. The retreating Philistines were slaughtered by the Israelites, which the Bible portrays positively. The text then states that Samuel erected a large stone at the battle site as a memorial, and there ensued a long period of peace thereafter.  King-maker  Samuel initially appointed his two sons as his successors; however, just like Eli\\'s sons, Samuel\\'s proved unworthy. The Israelites rejected them. Because of the external threat from other tribes, such as the Philistines, the tribal leaders decided that there was a need for a more unified, central government,[https://books.google.com/books?id nTtJAwAAQBAJ&pgPA51&dq prophet+samuel+bible&hlen&sa X&eiWhuPVf_NAtijyASCxAk&ved 0CEMQ6AEwBTgK#vonepage&q prophet%20samuel%20bible&ffalse Zucker, David J., The Bible\\'s Prophets, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2013, ISBN 9781630871024] and demanded Samuel appoint a king so that they could be like other nations. Samuel interprets this as a personal rejection, and at first is reluctant to oblige, until reassured by a divine revelation. He warns the people of the potential negative consequences of such a decision. Samuel was a known chozeh, a seer believed to be endowed with true spiritual insight, in contrast to the false prophets, enchanters and magicians of the neighboring nations. When Saul and his servant were searching for his father\\'s lost asses, the servant suggested consulting the nearby Samuel. Samuel recognized Saul as the future king.  Just before his retirement, Samuel gathered the people to an assembly at Gilgal, and gave them a farewell speech in which he emphasised how prophets and judges were more important than kings, how kings should be held to account, and how the people should not fall into idol worship, or worship of Asherah or of Baal; Samuel threatened that God would subject the people to foreign invaders should they disobey. This is seen by some as a deuteronomic redaction; since archaeological finds indicate that Asherah was still worshipped in Israelite households well into the 6th century. However, the Bible says in 1 Kings 11:5, 33, and 2 Kings 23:13 that the Israelites fell into Asherah worship later on.   When Saul in preparing to fight the Philistines, Samuel denounces him for proceeding with the pre-battle sacrifice without waiting for the overdue Samuel to arrive. He prophesies that Saul\\'s rule will see no dynastic succession. During the campaign against the Amalekites, King Saul spared Agag, the king of the Amalekites, and the best of their livestock. Saul tells Samuel that he spared the choicest of the Amalekites\\' sheep and oxen, intending to sacrifice the livestock to the Lord. This was in violation of the Lord\\'s command, as pronounced by Samuel, to \"... utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass\" (1 Samuel 15:3). Samuel confronts Saul for his disobedience and tells him that God made him king, and God can unmake him king. Samuel then proceeded to execute Agag. Saul never saw Samuel alive again after this.   Samuel then proceeds to Bethelehem and secretly anoints David king. He would later provide sanctuary for David, when the jealous Saul first tried to have him killed. Samuel died and was buried in Ramah. According to classical rabbinical sources, this was at the age of fifty-two.  Saul later had the Witch of Endor conjure Samuel\\'s ghost in order to predict the result of an up-coming battle. This passage is ascribed by textual scholars to the republican source. Classical rabbinical sources say that Samuel was terrified by the ordeal, having expected to be appearing to face God\\'s judgement, and had therefore brought Moses with him (to the land of the living) as a witness to his adherence to the mitzvot.  Source Criticism  National prophet, local seer  Some authors see the biblical Samuel as combining descriptions of two distinct roles: *A seer, based at Ramah, and seemingly known scarcely beyond the immediate neighbourhood of Ramah (Saul, for example, not having heard of him, with his servant informing him of his existence instead). In this role, Samuel is associated with the bands of musical ecstatic roaming prophets (Nevi\\'im - neb\\'im) at Gibeah, Bethel, and Gilgal, and some traditional scholars have argued that Samuel was the founder of these groups. At Ramah, Samuel secretly anoints Saul, after having met him for the first time, while Saul was looking for his father\\'s lost donkeys, and treated him to a meal. *A prophet, based at Shiloh, who went throughout the land, from place to place, with unwearied zeal, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people to repentance. In this role, Samuel acted as a (biblical) judge, publicly advising the nation, and also giving private advice to individuals. Eventually Samuel delegates this role to his sons, based at Beersheba, but they behave corruptly and so the people, facing invasion from the Ammonites, persuade Samuel to appoint a king. Samuel reluctantly does so, and anoints Saul in front of the entire nation, who had gathered to see him.  Source-critical scholarship suggests that these two roles come from different sources, which later were spliced together to form the Book(s) of Samuel. The oldest is considered to be that which marks Samuel as the local seer of Ramah, who willingly anoints Saul as King in secret, while the latter is that which presents Samuel as a national figure, who begrudgingly anoints Saul as King in front of a national assembly. This later source is generally known as the republican source, since here, and elsewhere, it denigrates the actions and role of the monarchy (particularly those of Saul) and favours religious figures, in contrast to the other main source – the monarchial source – which treats the monarchy favourably. Theoretically if we had the monarchial source we would see Saul appointed king by public acclamation, due to his military victories, and not by cleromancy involving Samuel. Another difference between the sources is that the republican source treats the shouters as somewhat independent from Samuel () rather than having been led by him ().  The passage in which Samuel is described as having exercised the functions of a (biblical) judge, during an annual circuit from Ramah to Bethel to Gilgal (the Gilgal between Ebal and Gerizim) to Mizpah and back to Ramah, is foreshadowed by Deborah, who used to render judgments from a place beneath a palm between Ramah and Bethel.[https://books.google.com/books?id -5KvCmOcEjgC&pgPA90&dq prophet+samuel+bible&hlen&sa X&eiWhuPVf_NAtijyASCxAk&ved 0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#vonepage&q prophet%20samuel%20bible&ffalse Christensen, Duane L., The Unity of the Bible, Paulist Press, 2003, ISBN 9780809141104]  Source-critical scholarship considers it to be a redaction aimed at harmonizing the two portrayals of Samuel.Jewish Encyclopedia, Samuel, Saul, Book of Samuel, et al.  The Book(s) of Samuel variously describe Samuel as having carried out sacrifices at sanctuaries, and having constructed and sanctified altars. According to the Priestly Code/Deuteronomic Code only Aaronic priests/Levites (depending on the underling tradition) were permitted to perform these actions, and simply being a nazarite or prophet was insufficient. The books of Samuel and Kings offer numerous examples where this rule is not followed by kings and prophets, but some critical scholars look elsewhere seeking a harmonization of the issues. In the Book of Chronicles, Samuel is described as a Levite, rectifying this situation; however critical scholarship widely sees the Book of Chronicles as an attempt to redact the Book(s) of Samuel and of Kings to conform to later religious sensibilities. Since many of the Biblical law codes themselves are thought to postdate the Book(s) of Samuel (according to the documentary hypothesis), Chronicles is probably making its claim based on religious bias. The Levitical genealogy of  is not historical, according to modern scholarship.  The Deuteronomistic Historians\\' Portrait of Samuel  The Deuteronomistic Historians, who redacted the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings), idealized Samuel as a figure who is larger than life like Joshua. Samuel\\'s father, Elkanah, is described as having originated from Zuph, specifically Ramathaim-Zophim, which was part of the tribal lands of Ephraim, while the Books of Chronicles state that he was a Levite.  Samuel is a judge who leads the military like in the Book of Judges and also who exercises judicial functions. In 1 Sam 12:6-17, the Deuteronomic Historians composed a speech of Samuel that puts him as the judge sent by God to save Israel.  In 1 Samuel 9:6-20, Samuel is seen as a local “seer.” The Deuteronomistic Historians preserved this view of Samuel while contributing him as “the first of prophets to articulate the failure of Israel to live up to its covenant with God.” For the Deuteronomistic Historians, Samuel was extension of Moses and continuing Moses’ function as a prophet, judge, and a priest which made historical Samuel uncertain. Adrian Zindi,argued that Samuel was prophet of God.  Perspectives on Samuel  Judaism   According to the Book of Jeremiah, and one of the Psalms (), Samuel had a high devotion to God. Classical Rabbinical literature adds that he was more than an equal to Moses, God speaking directly to Samuel, rather than Samuel having to attend the tabernacle to hear God.  Samuel is also described by the Rabbis as having been extremely intelligent; he argued that it was legitimate for laymen to slaughter sacrifices, since the Halakha only insisted that the priests bring the blood (cf , Zebahim 32a).Berakot 31b Eli, who was viewed negatively by many Classical Rabbis, is said to have reacted to this logic of Samuel by arguing that it was technically true, but Samuel should be put to death for making legal statements while Eli (his mentor) was present.  Samuel is also treated by the Classical Rabbis as a much more sympathetic character than he appears at face value in the Bible; his annual circuit is explained as being due to his wish to spare people the task of having to journey to him; Samuel is said to have been very rich, taking his entire household with him on the circuit so that he didn\\'t need to impose himself on anyone\\'s hospitality; when Saul fell out of God\\'s favour, Samuel is described as having grieved copiously and having prematurely aged.   Christianity   For Evangelical Christians Samuel is considered to be a Prophet, Judge, and wise Leader of Israel, and treated as an example of fulfilled commitments to God. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, as well as the Lutheran calendar, his feast day is August 20. He is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30. In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the commemoration of the departure of Samuel the Prophet is celebrated on 9 Paoni.  Herbert Lockyer and others have seen in Samuel\\'s combined offices of prophet, priest, and ruler a type of Christ.   Islam  Samuel is also a revered prophet  and seer in the Islamic faith. The narrative of Samuel in Muslim literature focuses specifically on his birth and the anointing of Saul. Other elements from his narrative are in accordance with the narratives of other prophets of Israel, as exegesis recounts Samuel\\'s preaching against idolatry. Although he is mentioned in the Qur\\'an, his name is not given but he is instead referred to as \"a Prophet\".  According to Islamic history, the Israelites, after the time of the prophet Moses, wanted a king to rule over their country. Thus, God sent the prophet Samuel to anoint Saul as the first king for the Israelites. The Qur\\'an states:  The Qur\\'an goes on to state that a king was anointed by the prophet, whose name was Talut (Saul in the Hebrew Bible). However, it states that the Israelites mocked and reviled the newly appointed king, as he was not wealthy from birth. But, in sharp contrast to the Hebrew Bible, the Qur\\'an praises Saul greatly, and mentions that he was gifted with great spiritual and physical strength.

She is the first woman to hold the post. She is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Dominica.  Early life and career  Scotland was born in Dominica, the 10th child of 12 born to Roman Catholic parents  a Dominican mother and Antiguan father.[http://www.afr.com/brand/rear-window/alexander-downer-narrowly-avoids-commonwealth-secretarygeneral-job-20151129-glanqm Her family emigrated to Walthamstow when she was two years old, where she attended Walthamstow School for Girls. She then went on to Mid Essex Technical College in Chelmsford, where she obtained an external London University (LLB) law degree. She was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1977, specialising in family law, and was called to the Dominican bar in 1978.   In 1991, Scotland became the first black woman to be appointed a Queen\\'s Counsel. She later founded 1 Gray\\'s Inn Square barristers chambers.  Early in 1997, she was elected as a Bencher of the Middle Temple. Scotland was named as a Millennium Commissioner on 17 February 1994, and was a member of the Commission for Racial Equality. She received a life peerage on a Labour Party list of working peers and was created Baroness Scotland of Asthal, of Asthal in the County of Oxfordshire on 30 October 1997.   From March 2015 to March 2016, Baroness Scotland served as senior advisor to Ron Wahid, Chairman of Arcanum, a subsidiary of Magellan Investment Holdings, Limited.  She stepped down in order to assume the role of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.   British government posts  From 1999 to 2001 Baroness Scotland was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where she was responsible, among others, for the UK Government\\'s diplomatic relations with North America, the Caribbean, Overseas Territories, Consular Division, British Council, administration and all Parliamentary business in the House of Lords.  Scotland introduced the International Criminal Court Bill which sought to ratify the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court into UK law. She established the Pro Bono Lawyers Panel, a panel of British-based lawyers who provided legal advice on a pro bono basis to United Kingdom nationals imprisoned in foreign countries. She created an Overseas Territories Council for the Caribbean and reformed and restructured the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\\'s Consular Division to be able to respond more effectively to emergencies and disasters abroad such as the 11 September attacks.  In 2001 she became Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor\\'s Department, and was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. She was the minister formally responsible for civil justice and the reform of civil law including the comprehensive reform of land registration leading to the Land Registration Act 2002. She was also formally responsible for international affairs at the Lord Chancellor\\'s Department and was appointed by Prime Minister Tony Blair as the UK Alternate Representative to the European Convention  and was given primary responsibility for the negotiations in relation to the Charter of Rights which were successfully concluded in 2003. During this period she consolidated the strong relations created with all the applicant countries through the FAHR programme and the member states and was subsequently awarded the Polish Medal for her contribution to the reform and development of Law in Poland.  Baroness Scotland was an unsuccessful hopeful contender for a cabinet position in 2003, when Prime Minister Blair reportedly considered appointing her Leader of the House of Lords.   In 2003 Baroness Scotland was made Minister of State for the Criminal Justice System and Law Reform at the Home Office and deputy to the Home Secretary. She served in that post until 2007 under three Home Secretaries: David Blunkett, Charles Clarke and John Reid. While at the Home Office she was responsible for major reform of the criminal justice system. She created the Office of Criminal Justice Reform  which helped to create and support the National Criminal Justice Board and the Local Criminal Justice Board. Having acted as Chair, she then created three Alliances to reduce re-offending (Corporate, Civic and Faith based Alliance) and the Corporate Alliance against Domestic Violence.  She created an advisory group on victims and the Criminal Justice Centre, Victims and Witness units.  Baroness Scotland created Inside Justice Week  and the Justice Awards. She introduced the Crime and Victims Act which created new offence of familial homicide which was successfully used to prosecute the killers of Baby P who would otherwise have escaped responsibility for his death.  Baroness Scotland continued her responsibility for international affairs at the Home Office and continued to represent the UK in a number of international negotiations such as those relating to extradition.  In 2004 Baroness Scotland was considered to be a possible candidate to become a commissioner of the European Union.  In November 2012, she was appointed Prime Ministerial Trade Envoy to South Africa.   Attorney General  On 28 June 2007 Baroness Scotland was appointed Attorney General by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. She was the first woman to hold the office since its foundation in 1315. As Attorney General she was the Chief legal adviser to: Her Majesty The Queen, Parliament and the Government, Supervisor and Superintendent of the Prosecutorial Authorities (the Crown Prosecution Service, Serious Fraud Office and Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office), Leader of the Bar and had non-statutory oversight of the prosecutors in government departments, the Treasury Solicitors Department and armed services prosecuting authority. She was Guardian of the Rule of Law and Public Interest. She was one of the three Cabinet Ministers responsible for the criminal justice system and had specific responsibility for fraud policy and the National Fraud Authority and chaired the Inter-Ministerial Group responsible for the improvement of the response to fraud and e-crime.  She was instrumental in creating the Quintet  that brought together the Attorneys General of the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to consider issues of joint legal and systemic concern. During her time as Attorney General, Baroness Scotland continued to promote pro bono  work by lawyers and created an international and Schools Pro Bono Committee which was responsible for co-ordinating pro bono work. She created the Pro Bono Awards and Pro Bono Heroes. She also created an Attorney General\\'s Youth Network.   She was the last Attorney General for England and Wales also to be the Attorney General for Northern Ireland before the devolution of justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and appointment of a separate Attorney General for Northern Ireland. She became instead Advocate General for Northern Ireland, the UK government\\'s chief advisor on Northern Ireland law, for a brief period until Labour left office.  When Labour left government on 11 May 2010, Baroness Scotland became the Shadow Attorney General and was reappointed to that role by Ed Miliband when he appointed his first Shadow Cabinet in October 2010, where she was instrumental in creating Labour\\'s strategy against Rupert Murdoch.  She is currently a president of Chatham House.   Local government  In December 2014 Baroness Scotland was elected as the Alderman for the ward of Bishopsgate in the City of London, having stood (in accordance with convention in the City) as an independent candidate.   Commonwealth Secretary-General  At the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Scotland was nominated for the position of Commonwealth Secretary-General by her native country of Dominica and defeated Antiguan diplomat Ronald Sanders, who was thought to have been the frontrunner for the position, and former deputy secretary-general for political affairs Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba of Botswana to become the 6th Commonwealth Secretary-General and the first woman to hold the post. She began her first of a maximum of two possible four-year terms on 1 April 2016.    Her candidacy had been opposed by Canada\\'s former special envoy to the Commonwealth and Senator Hugh Segal who wrote in an editorial that she was not qualified for the position \"for having accepted a well-paying brief from a junta in the Maldives to argue against the Commonwealth’s legitimacy when it and Canada sought the restoration of democracy in that country.\"    Charitable work  Baroness Scotland is the Patron of the Corporate Alliance Against Domestic Violence.  She is the joint Patron of Missio,  a charity which is the Catholic Church\\'s official support organisation for overseas mission.   She is also a patron of Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB), a charity dedicated to reuniting children who have been separated from their families.   Awards  Baroness Scotland has been voted Peer of the Year by Channel 4,  the House Magazine,  Parliamentarian of the Year by the Spectator  and the Political Studies Association,  and received a number of other awards for her contribution to law reform in the UK and abroad.  Baroness Scotland was awarded an Honorary Degree from the University of East London in 2005.  She was voted one of the 100 Great Black Britons.   Baroness Scotland was decreed and invested by Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, as a Dame of Merit with Star of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George in 2003. In 2014 she was appointed to the Council of the British and Irish Delegation of the Constantinian Order and promoted in rank to Dame Grand Cross of Merit.   On 1 January 2014 she was appointed chancellor of the University of Greenwich.   NatWest Three  A new extradition treaty with the United States of America had been signed on 31 March 2003. Scotland had the responsibility for promoting the necessary legislation in the House of Lords.  The \"NatWest Three\" extradition case made use of this treaty. The three men were British citizens, living in the UK and working for the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, a British bank. On 12 July 2006, in a highly unusual move, the Speaker of the House, Michael Martin, allowed an emergency debate on both the treaty and the NatWest Three after a request by Liberal Democrat frontbencher Nick Clegg.  During the debate, Scotland\\'s view in 2005 that a higher threshold to establish \"probable cause\" was required by the UK to extradite from the US than vice versa was contrasted by Clegg to comments which the Prime Minister had made in July 2006, in which he stated that the evidential burdens on the two countries were the same.  The NatWest Three were subsequently extradited, and accepted a plea-bargain arrangement under which they pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud in the United States and were sentenced to 37 months imprisonment.  Illegal immigrant employment penalty  In 2009 Scotland employed Lolo Tapui, an illegal immigrant. Tapui had been using a forged passport for the period up to and including December 2008. Scotland began to employ Tapui in January 2009. Tapui was later jailed for eight months for fraud, possessing a false identity stamp, and overstaying her UK visa. At her trial Tapui admitted to having been paid £95,000 by the Daily Mail. She was later deported to native Tonga.   Scotland had earlier been subjected to a penalty of £5,000 for not keeping, as an employer, copies of documents used to check Tapui\\'s immigration status, under rules Scotland helped draft as a Home Office minister. The investigation by the UK Border Agency found that Scotland did not \"knowingly\" employ an illegal worker. But Scotland, who was Attorney General at the time, was fined for failing to keep copies of those papers, under rules she helped draft as a Home Office minister.   Personal life  Scotland resides in London  and in Asthal, where she and her husband, also a barrister, live with their two sons.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":41}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"yTeQdovMc3W_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1623405010305,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":221,"user":{"displayName":"kathatha prapra","photoUrl":"","userId":"13654869404901739790"}},"outputId":"b31d848c-9b67-4b7f-dcad-468490619a50"},"source":["for qa_pair in preprocessed_qa_wikipedia_test_without_answers[:500]:\n","  if qa_pair['QuestionId'] in nothing_found[4]:\n","    print(qa_pair[\"QuestionId\"])\n","    print(qa_pair[\"Question\"])\n","    print(qa_pair ['Question_preprocessed'])\n","    print(qa_pair[\"EntityPages\"][0]['Filename'])\n","\n","\n","doc_id = top_50_bm25[nothing_found[4]][0][0]\n","print(doc_id)\n","documents_dict[doc_id]\n","\n","## Reason: Word with multiple meanings - all words of query contained in doc, but question not answered.

He is the second child of the Jackson family and the oldest Jackson brother.  Early life  Sigmund Esco Jackson was born on his mother Katherine\\'s 21st birthday in 1951. Nicknamed Jackie by his grandfather, taken from Jackson Boy, he came from an African-American working-class family. He and his brothers and sisters grew up in a three-room house in Gary, Indiana, an industrial city outside of Chicago. In 1964, Jackie\\'s father, Joseph, formed the Jackson Brothers singing group, which included Jackie and his brothers Tito and Jermaine. The group included younger brothers Marlon and Michael playing assorted percussive instruments. By 1966, Joseph made Michael the lead singer and within two years, they emerged professionally under the name The Jackson Five, which was later altered to a numeral 5 after signing with Motown in 1969.  Prior to the group signing with Motown, Jackson wanted to pursue a career in professional baseball, in fact, he was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in 1970. However, he decided to stay in music.  Career  Jackson performed under a high tenor singing voice. He added brief lead parts in some of the Jackson 5\\'s hit singles, including \"I Want You Back\" and \"ABC\". In 1973, Jackson released a solo album that failed to chart. After the Jackson 5 became The Jacksons after leaving Motown for CBS Records in 1976, Jackson\\'s role as a vocalist and songwriter increased. He added a lead vocal alongside brother Michael on their top ten Epic single, \"Enjoy Yourself\", and also added composition on six of the group\\'s albums with Epic. Jackson\\'s voice changed to a lower tenor vocal style during the Epic years. One of Jackson\\'s most successful compositions was co-writing with Michael, \"Can You Feel It\", which became an international hit in 1981. Jackson began performing more lead vocals as Michael pursued a successful solo career. On their 1984 album, Victory, Jackson performed lead on the song \"Wait\", while writing the single, \"Torture\". Notably before the start of the Victory Tour in 1984, Jackson suffered a leg injury that was officially described as a knee injury incurred during rehearsals.  However, a former companion of Jermaine Jackson\\'s, Margaret Maldonado, wrote in her 1995 book, Jackson Family Values, Jackson was injured in an automobile accident, a cause of his then wife Enid Jackson running over Jackson with her car, after catching him with choreographer and then-Laker Girl Paula Abdul.  Jackson recovered well enough to perform on the last leg of shows in December 1984 in Los Angeles, where Michael announced he was leaving the group. In early 1985, Marlon Jackson joined Michael in leaving the group as well.  Jackie, Tito and Randy became session musicians, vocalists and producers during this time. In 1987, Jackie, Randy, Tito and Jermaine reformed as The Jacksons and recorded \"Time Out for the Burglar\", the theme song for the film, Burglar. The single was a minor R&B hit in the US, but had more success in Belgium where it peaked in the Top 40 at #17 for two consecutive weeks. The Jacksons also contributed backing vocals to the Tito-produced title track of Tramaine Hawkins\\' 1987 album \"Freedom\". In late 1988, the Jacksons set out to record their final Epic album, 2300 Jackson Street, which included Jackie and Jermaine splitting leads on most of the songs. 2300 Jackson Street failed to chart successfully despite the Randy and Jermaine-led \"Nothin\\' (That Compares 2 U)\". Randy did not participate in much of the album\\'s promotion as he was working on his solo project leaving Jackie, Tito and Jermaine to promote the album mostly overseas. Afterwards, the group was dropped from the label and each brother went into solo projects. Jackson signed with Polydor and released his first solo album in 16 years, Be the One, in late 1989. The album was a minor hit charting at #89 on the R&B charts. The first single \"Stay\" was a Top 40 R&B hit while second single \"Cruzin\\'\" was a moderate success. In 2001, after years out of the limelight, Jackie, along with his other brothers, returned to the mainstream during a reunion performance with Michael at his 30th anniversary special at Madison Square Garden.  Recent years  Currently residing in Las Vegas, Jackson at one time ran two record companies, Jesco Records and Futurist Entertainment. His son, Sigmund, Jr., known by the name of DEALZ, released a mixtape off Jesco in 2007. In 2009, he, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon starred in their brief reality series, The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty. In 2012, the quartet began their first tour since the end of the Victory Tour in 1984. The four brothers continue to tour, currently planning to perform a series of shows at the Las Vegas casino circuit.  Personal life  Jackson has been married three times. He married his first wife, Enid Spann, in November 1974. A rocky marriage, they initially separated for several months after they married, but later reconciled. They had two children. They divorced in 1987.  In the late 1980s, Jackson was the subject of media coverage when he dated pop star Paula Abdul.  In 2001, Jackson married a second wife, Victoria Triggs. They later divorced.  Jackson married his third wife Emily Besselink, who gave birth to twin boys River and Jaylen in 2014.

Creatures as collectives are not included. Characters are categorized by race. Spelling and point of view are given as from The Hobbit; details from sources outside The Hobbit are given only where important to understanding the character within the tale, and with the source explicitly noted.  Hobbits  * Bilbo Baggins of Bag End, the protagonist and titular hobbit of the story. * Bungo Baggins, Bilbo\\'s father. * Belladonna Took, Bilbo\\'s mother. * The Old Took, Bilbo\\'s maternal grandfather. * Chubb, Chubb, and Burrowes, auctioneers managing the liquidation of Bilbo’s effects. * The Sackville-Bagginses, “cousins” to Bilbo. They arranged an auction to dispose of Bilbo’s effects long after he disappeared. Bilbo returned during the auction, upsetting the plans the Sackville-Bagginses had for moving into his fine hobbit hole. Bilbo suspected them of making off with some of his silver spoons. * Bullroarer Took, a historical figure mentioned as Bilbo\\'s great great grand-uncle. He led the defence against the goblins of Mount Gram and is purported to have knocked the goblin leader Golfimbul\\'s head off with a blow from his club, sending it flying into a rabbit hole and thereby inventing the sport of golf.  Wizards  * Gandalf, the mastermind behind the The Hobbit\\'s quest. * Radagast, a wizard mentioned as a \"cousin\" of Gandalf.  Dwarves  * Dain, second cousin to Thorin, came to the aid of Thorin\\'s Company at the Battle of Five Armies with a company of several hundred dwarves.  Thorin\\'s company  Thorin\\'s company consisted of the following 13 dwarves; their quest in The Hobbit is the main impetus of the plot. Their quest was joined by Bilbo Baggins (a hobbit) and occasionally by the wizard Gandalf. * Thorin Oakenshield, leader of the company and possessor of the longest beard. He wore a gold belt, and a sky blue hood with a large silver tassel. Thorin played the harp. *Thorin\\'s nephews (sons of his sister Dís as known from The Lord of the Rings): ** Fili, who with his brother Kili was the youngest dwarf in the company and therefore useful for his keen eyesight. He wore a blue hood and grew a yellow beard. ** Kili, who with his brother Fili was the youngest dwarf in the company and therefore useful for his keen eyesight. He wore a blue hood and grew a yellow beard. *Four of Thorin\\'s third-cousins - two pairs of brothers: ** Balin. Older brother to Dwalin, he wore a red hood and had a white beard. Bilbo and Balin later became good friends. ** Dwalin. Younger brother to Balin, he wore a dark green hood and a golden belt, had a blue beard tucked into the belt, and, like his brother Balin, he played viol.  He was the first of the dwarves that Bilbo met. ** Oin. Brother to Gloin, he wore a brown hood. He and Gloin were charged with starting the campfires. ** Gloin. Brother to Oin, he wore a white hood. He and Oin were charged with starting the campfires. Gloin openly doubted Bilbo at the start of the quest.  *Three dwarves who were Thorin\\'s remote kinsmen: ** Dori. He wore a purple hood. Dori was tasked with carrying Bilbo in the goblin tunnels.  ** Nori. He wore a purple hood. ** Ori. He wore a grey hood. *Three dwarves \"descended from the Dwarves of Moria but were not of Durin\\'s line\":  ** Bifur. Cousin to Bofur and Bombur, he wore a yellow hood and played clarinet.  ** Bofur. Cousin to Bifur and brother to Bombur, he wore a yellow hood and played clarinet. ** Bombur, whose primary traits were his fatness and his sympathy for Bilbo\\'s plights. He wore a pale green hood.  Elves  * Elrond, master of Rivendell, the Last Homely House East of the Sea. The Hobbit calls him an elf-friend rather than an elf, one \"who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors.\"  (The Lord of the Rings relates that Elrond was born half-elven but chose the path of the elves.) * The Elvenking, king of the Mirkwood Elves. He held the dwarves captive. They were eventually freed by Bilbo. (In The Lord of the Rings, he is given the name Thranduil.) * Galion, the butler of the Elvenking\\'s halls, whose fondness for wine enables Bilbo and the dwarves to escape.  Men  * Bard the Bowman, an archer of Lake-town who slew Smaug. * Beorn the \"skin-changer\", master of the Carrock, able to take the form of a bear. He fought against the goblins at the Battle of Five Armies along with the men, elves and dwarves. Beorn may not have been a man; Gandalf states in The Hobbit that he believes the story calling Beorn \"... a man descended from the first men who lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world\" rather than the other common story, that \"he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there before the giants came\". In The Lord of the Rings, they refer to his kind as Beornings. * The Master of Lake-town, a grasping politician who met his end starving in the wilderness with the wealth he plundered from his own people after the destruction of Lake-town. He is not named explicitly but had the nickname \"Money bags\".  Trolls  * Tom, one of the three trolls who captured the members of the Company. The trolls argued over how to prepare their captives for eating, goaded on by the impersonating voice of Gandalf. They argued until dawn, when the sun\\'s rays turned them to stone. * Bert, one of the three trolls who captured the members of the Company. * William (Bill Huggins), one of the three trolls who captured the members of the Company.  Singular characters  * Gollum, a creature left largely to mystery in The Hobbit. He lived alone deep under the Misty Mountains on an island in a dark, cold lake. He lost his magic ring, which Bilbo found, and engaged Bilbo in a riddle game in order to stall for time. Ultimately Bilbo escaped with the ring. In The Lord of the Rings it is revealed that Gollum is a degenerate hobbit of great age whose name was originally Sméagol. * The Necromancer, a shadowy evil character mentioned in The Hobbit. In The Lord of the Rings, The Necromancer is seen to be Sauron. * Smaug, a great dragon who made the Lonely Mountain his lair. After the Company roused him from his long quiescence, he destroyed Lake-town and was killed by Bard.  Birds  * The Lord of the Eagles, a giant eagle who, with the other eagles, bore the Company away from the burning treetops the goblins had trapped them in, and who aided the allies at the Battle of Five Armies. * Carc, an intelligent raven who lived upon the Ravenhill beneath the Lonely Mountain in the days of King Thrór. * Roäc, son of Carc; the leader of the great ravens of the Lonely Mountain. * A thrush who watches over the party at the Lonely Mountain and furthers their interests.  Goblins  *The Great Goblin, whose kingdom lay under the Misty Mountains. Warriors of his realm waylaid the Company and took them prisoner. Gandalf slew the Great Goblin when he rescued the Company. *Bolg, who succeeded the Great Goblin, led an army of goblins in the Battle of Five Armies. *Golfimbul, leader of the goblins of Mount Gram. He was killed by Bullroarer Took at the Battle of Greenfields, already a historical event at the time of The Hobbit.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"IF-gJePWe2QM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1623405069633,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":228,"user":{"displayName":"kathatha prapra","photoUrl":"","userId":"13654869404901739790"}},"outputId":"b8f24ad5-603e-4f4a-8487-313303a31165"},"source":["for qa_pair in preprocessed_qa_wikipedia_test_without_answers[:500]:\n","  if qa_pair['QuestionId'] in nothing_found[6]:\n","    print(qa_pair[\"QuestionId\"])\n","    print(qa_pair[\"Question\"])\n","    print(qa_pair ['Question_preprocessed'])\n","    print(qa_pair[\"EntityPages\"][0]['Filename'])\n","\n","\n","doc_id = top_50_bm25[nothing_found[6]][0][0]\n","print(doc_id)\n","documents_dict[doc_id]\n","\n","## Reason: Word with multiple meanings - all words of query contained in doc, but question not answered.

For the 110\\xa0m hurdles, the first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13.72\\xa0metres (45\\xa0ft) from the starting line. The next nine hurdles are set at a distance of 9.14\\xa0metres (30\\xa0ft) from each other, and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 14.02\\xa0metres (46\\xa0ft) long.  The Olympic Games have included the 110\\xa0metre hurdles in their program since 1896. The equivalent hurdles race for women was run over a course of 80\\xa0metres from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the 1972 Summer Olympics, the women's race was set at 100\\xa0metres. In the early 20th century, the race was often contested as 120\\xa0yard hurdles, thus the Imperial units distances between hurdles.  The fastest 110\\xa0metre hurdlers run the distance in around 13\\xa0seconds. Aries Merritt of the United States holds the current world record of 12.80 seconds, set at the Memorial Van Damme meet on 7 September 2012 in Belgium.  History  For the first hurdles races in England around 1830, wooden barriers were placed along a stretch of 100\\xa0yards (91.44\\xa0m).  The first standards were attempted in 1864 in Oxford and Cambridge:  The length of the course was set to 120\\xa0yards (109.7 m) and over its course, runners were required to clear ten 3 foot 6\\xa0inch (1.07 m) high hurdles. The height and spacing of the hurdles have been related to Imperial units ever since.  After the length of the course was rounded up to 110 metres in France in 1888, the standards were pretty much complete (except for Germany where 1 metre high hurdles were used until 1907).  The massively constructed hurdles of the early days were first replaced in 1895 with somewhat lighter T-shaped hurdles that runners were able to knock over.  However, until 1935 runners were disqualified if they knocked down more than three hurdles, and records were only recognized if the runner had left all hurdles standing.  In 1935 the T-shaped hurdles were replaced by L-shaped ones that easily fall forward if bumped into and therefore reduce the risk of injury.  However those hurdles are weighted so it is disadvantageous to hit them.  The current running style where the first hurdle is taken on the run with the upper body lowered instead of being jumped over and with three steps each between the hurdles was first used by the 1900 Olympic champion, Alvin Kraenzlein.  The 110 metre hurdles have been an Olympic discipline since 1896.  Women ran it occasionally in the 1920s but it never became generally accepted.  From 1926 on, women have only run the 80 metre hurdles which was increased to 100 metres starting in 1961 on a trial basis and in 1969 in official competition.  In 1900 and 1904, the Olympics also included a 200-metre hurdles race, and the IAAF recognized world records for the 200 metre hurdles until 1960.  Don Styron held the world record in the event for over 50 years until Andy Turner broke the record in a specially arranged race at the Manchester City Games in 2010.  Styron still holds the world record in the 220 yard low hurdles.  Technique  The sprint hurdles are a very rhythmic race because both men and women take 3 steps (meaning 4 foot strikes) between each hurdle, no matter whether running 110/100 meters outdoors, or the shorter distances indoors (55 or 60 meters). In addition, the distance from the starting line to the first hurdle - while shorter for women - is constant for both sexes whether indoors or outdoors, so sprint hurdlers do not need to change their stride pattern between indoor and outdoor seasons. One difference between indoor and outdoors is the shorter finishing distance from the last (5th) hurdle indoors, compared to longer distance from the last (10th) hurdle outdoors to the finish line.   Top male hurdlers traditionally took 8 strides from the starting blocks to the first hurdle (indoors and outdoors). The 8-step start persisted from (at least) the 1950s to the end of the 20th century and included such World- and Olympic champions as Harrison Dillard, Rod Milburn, Greg Foster, Renaldo Nehemiah, Roger Kingdom, Allen Johnson, Mark Crear, Mark McCoy, and Colin Jackson. However, beginning in the 2000s, some hurdle coaches embraced a transition to a faster 7-step start, teaching the men to lengthen their first few strides out of the starting blocks. Cuban hurdler Dayron Robles set his 2008 world record of 12.87 using a 7-step start. Chinese star Liu Xiang won the 2004 Olympics and broke the world record in 2006 utilizing an 8-step approach, but he switched to 7-steps by the 2011 outdoor season. After the 2010 outdoor season, American Jason Richardson trained to switch to a 7-step start and went on to win the 2011 World Championship. American Aries Merritt trained in Fall 2011 to switch from 8 to 7, and then had his greatest outdoor season in 2012 - running 8 races in under 13 seconds - capped by winning the London 2012 Olympics and then setting a world record of 12.80.   Of the 10 men with the fastest 110m hurdle times in 2012, seven used 7-steps, including the top 4: Aries Merritt, Liu Xiang, Jason Richardson, and David Oliver. Hurdle technique experts believe the off-season training required to produce the power and speed necessary to reach the first hurdle in 7 steps, yields greater endurance over the last half of the race. That added endurance allows hurdlers to maintain their top speed to the finish, resulting in a faster time.

He was the No. 1 ranked professional from 1964 to 1970, spanning four years before and three years after the start of the Open Era. He also was the No. 1 amateur in 1961–62 according to Lance Tingay.  Laver\\'s 200 singles titles are the most in tennis history, and he holds the all-time male singles records of 22 titles in a single season (1962) and seven consecutive years (1964–70) winning at least 10 titles per season. He excelled on all of the court surfaces of his time: grass, clay, hard, carpet, and wood/parquet.  Despite being banned from playing the Grand Slam tournaments for the five years prior to the Open Era, he still won 11 singles titles. He is the only player to twice achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam, in 1962 and 1969, and remains the only man to do so during the Open Era. He also won eight Pro Slam titles, including the calendar year Pro \"Grand Slam\"  in 1967, and contributed to five Davis Cup titles for Australia during an age when Davis Cup was deemed as significant as the Grand Slams.   Personal life  Rodney George Laver was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia, on 9 August 1938.   He was the third of four children of Roy Laver, a cattleman and butcher, and his wife Melba Roffey.  In 1966 Laver, aged 27, married Mary Benson in San Rafael, California. Born Mary Shelby Peterson in Illinois, she was a divorcee with three children. After their wedding ceremony, a group of well known tennis players in attendance, including Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Mal Anderson and Barry MacKay, stood outside the church with raised tennis rackets that formed an archway for the newlyweds to walk under.  Laver and Mary had a son and the family lived at various locations in California including Rancho Mirage, Corona del Mar, a ranch near Santa Barbara and Carlsbad. Mary Laver died in November 2012 at the age of 84 at their home in Carlsbad.   Playing style  Although of a slightly short and medium build (1.73 m/5\\xa0ft 8\"), Laver developed a technically complete serve-and-volley game, with aggressive groundstrokes to back it up. Dan Maskell described him as \"technically faultless.\"   His left-handed serve was well disguised and wide swinging. His groundstrokes on both flanks were hit with topspin, as was the attacking topspin lob, which Laver developed into a weapon. His stroke technique was based on quick shoulder turns, true swings, and accurate timing. His backhand, often hit on the run, was a point-ender that gave him an advantage. Laver was very quick and had a strong left forearm. Rex Bellamy wrote, \"The strength of that wrist and forearm gave him blazing power without loss of control, even when he was on the run and at full stretch. The combination of speed and strength, especially wrist strength, enabled him to hit ferocious winners when way out of court.\"  At the net, he had forcing volleys, often hit as stroke volleys. Especially on the backhand, he could hit sharp underspin angles as well.  He was difficult to lob, because of his springing agility, and when forced to retreat, he could come up with a vicious counterpunch.  As an amateur, Laver was a somewhat flashy player, often a late starter. He had to learn to control his adventurous shot-making and integrate percentage tennis into his game when he turned professional. In his prime, he could adapt his style to all surfaces and to all conditions. Laver had a strong record in five-set-matches, often turning things around with subtle changes of tactics.  Career  Amateur (1956–62)  Laver was a young boy when he left school to pursue a tennis career that lasted 24 years. He was coached in Queensland by Charlie Hollis and later by the Australian Davis Cup team captain Harry Hopman, who gave Laver the nickname \"Rocket\".  Laver was both Australian and US Junior champion in 1957. He had his breakthrough on the world stage in 1959, when he reached all three finals at Wimbledon, winning the mixed doubles title with Darlene Hard. As an unseeded player, he lost the singles final to Peruvian Alex Olmedo after surviving an 87-game semifinal against American Barry MacKay. His first major singles title was the Australian Championships in 1960, where he defeated fellow Australian Neale Fraser in a five-set final after coming back from two sets down and saving a Fraser championship point in the fourth set. Laver captured his first Wimbledon singles crown in 1961.  In 1962, Laver became the first male player since Don Budge in 1938 to win all four Grand Slam singles titles in the same year and won an additional 18 titles (22) in all. Among those titles were the Italian Championships and the German Championships, giving Laver the \"clay court triple\" of Paris, Rome, and Hamburg that had been achieved previously only by Lew Hoad in 1956. The biggest hurdle to Laver\\'s winning the Grand Slam was the French Championships on slow clay, where Laver won three consecutive five-setters beginning with the quarterfinals. In his quarterfinal with Martin Mulligan, Laver saved a matchpoint in the fourth set with a backhand volley after coming to the net behind a second serve. In the final, Laver lost the first two sets and was down 0–3 in the fourth set before coming back to defeat Roy Emerson. At Wimbledon, his progress was much easier. Laver lost only one set the whole tournament, to Manuel Santana in a quarterfinal, who held a set point for a two set lead. At the US Championships, Laver lost only two sets during the tournament and defeated Emerson again in the final.    In February 1963, he appeared on the panel game show To Tell the Truth, where all four panelists identified him based on his knowledge of the history of tennis.   Professional  Before the Open Era (1963–68)  In December 1962 Laver turned professional after winning the Davis Cup with the Australian team. After an initial period of adjustment he quickly established himself among the leading professional players such as Ken Rosewall, Lew Hoad and Andrés Gimeno, and also Pancho Gonzales when Gonzales returned to a full-time schedule in 1964. During the next seven years, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times, including four in a row beginning in 1966.  In the beginning of 1963, Laver was beaten consistently by both Rosewall and Hoad on an Australasian tour. Hoad won the first eight matches against Laver, and Rosewall won 11 out of 13. By the end of the year, however, with six tournament titles, Laver had become the No. 2 professional player behind Rosewall.   In 1964, Laver and Rosewall both won seven important titles (in minor tournaments Laver won four and Rosewall won three), but Laver won 15 of 19 matches against Rosewall and captured the two most prestigious titles, the US Pro Championships over Gonzales and the Wembley Championships over Rosewall. In tennis week, Raymond Lee has described the Wembley match, where Laver came from 5–3 down in the fifth set to win 8–6, as possibly their best ever and one that changed tennis history. Lee regards this win as the one that began and established Laver\\'s long reign as world number one. The other prestige title, the French pro, was won by Rosewall.  In 1965, Laver was clearly the No. 1 professional player,  winning 17 titles  and 13 of 18 matches against Rosewall. In ten finals, Laver won eight against the still dangerous Gonzales.  In 1966, Laver won 16 events, including the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championship, and eight other important tournaments.  In 1967, Laver won 19 titles, including the Wimbledon Pro, the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championship, and the French Pro Championship, which gave him a clean sweep of the most important professional titles, a professional Grand Slam. The tournament in 1967 on Wimbledon\\'s Centre Court was the only professional event ever staged on that court before the Open Era began. Laver beat Rosewall in the final 6–2, 6–2, 12–10.  During the Open Era (1968–76)  With the dawn of the Open Era in 1968, professional players were once again allowed to compete in Grand Slam events. Laver became Wimbledon\\'s first Open Era champion in 1968, beating the best amateur, American Arthur Ashe, in a semifinal and fellow-Australian Tony Roche in the final, both in straight sets.   Laver was also the runner-up to Ken Rosewall in the first French Open. In this first \"open\" year, there were only eight open events besides Wimbledon and the French Open, where professionals, registered players, and amateurs could compete against each other. The professionals mainly played their own circuit, with two groups – National Tennis League (NTL) and World Championships Tennis (WCT)\\xa0– operating. Laver was ranked No. 1 universally, winning the US Professional Championships on grass and the French Pro Championship on clay (both over John Newcombe).   Laver also won the last big open event of the year, the Pacific Southwest in Los Angeles on hard courts.  Ashe regarded Laver\\'s 4–6, 6–0, 6–0 final win over Ken Rosewall as one of his finest performances.  Laver\\'s post-match comment was, \"This is the kind of match you always dream about. The kind you play at night in your sleep.\"  In 1969, Laver won all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time, sealing the achievement with a four-set win over Roche in the US Open final. He won 18 of the 32 singles tournaments he entered (still the Open Era titles record) and compiled a 106–16 win-loss record. In beating Newcombe in four sets in the Wimbledon final, he captured the title at the All England Club for the fourth consecutive time that he had entered the tournament (and reached the final for the sixth consecutive time as he had been runner-up in 1959 and 1960). He set a record of 31 consecutive match victories at Wimbledon between 1961 and 1970, which lasted until 1980 when it was eclipsed by Björn Borg. Unlike his first Grand Slam year in 1962, Laver in 1969 played in events open to all the best professional and amateur players of the world. In the year\\'s Grand Slam tournaments, Laver had five five-set-matches, twice coming back from two sets down in early rounds. In the four finals, however, he lost a total of only two sets. His hardest match was a marathon 90-game semifinal against Roche at the Australian Open under tropical hot conditions. Other opponents at the Australian Open included Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle, and Andrés Gimeno. At the French Open, Laver beat Gimeno, Tom Okker, and Rosewall. At Wimbledon, Laver overcame strong challenges from Stan Smith, Cliff Drysdale, Ashe, and Newcombe. At the US Open on slippery grass courts, he defeated Dennis Ralston, Emerson, Ashe, and Roche. Laver proved his versatility by winning the Grand Slam tournaments on grass and clay, plus the two most important hard court titles (South African Open at Ellis Park, Johannesburg and the US Professional Championships at Boston) and the leading indoor tournaments (Philadelphia US Pro Indoor and Wembley British Indoor). With US$124,000 in prize money, he was also the first player to break the US$100,000 barrier in a year.  In the early 1970s, Laver lost his grip on the major tournaments. He played only five Grand Slam tournaments from 1970 through 1972. This was partly because of his contracts with NTL and WCT. But on the WCT tours, he remained the leading player and by far the leading prize money winner.  In 1970, Laver won 15 titles and US$201,453 in prize money, including the rich \"Tennis Champions Classic\" and five other big events (Sydney Dunlop Open, Philadelphia, Wembley, Los Angeles, South African Open). Those were the equivalent of the modern day ATP Masters Series. With only two majors played by all the best players (Wimbledon and the US Open), there was no clear-cut World No. 1 in 1970. Wimbledon champion Newcombe, US champion Rosewall, and Laver (who won the most titles and had a 3–0 win-loss record against Newcombe and a 5–0 record against Rosewall) were ranked the highest by different journalists and expert panels. Although Newcombe was top ranked by Lance Tingay, Newcombe wrote later in his autobiography \"Newk-Life on and off the Court\" (2002) that the top honour in 1970 belonged to Laver.  In 1971 he won seven titles, including the Italian Open in Rome on clay over Jan Kodeš, the reigning French Open champion. Laver successfully defended his title at the \"Tennis Champions Classic\", winning 13 consecutive winner-take-all matches against top opponents and US$160,000. For the year, Laver won a then-record US$292,717 in tournament prize money and became the first tennis player to surpass US$1\\xa0million in career prize money. In 1971 and 1972, Laver finished as the points leader of the WCT tournament series but lost the playoff finals at Dallas to Rosewall. The last match is rated as one of the best of all time and drew a TV audience of over 20 million.  In 1972, Laver cut back his tournament schedule, partly because of back and knee injuries and his tennis camp businesses, but he still won five titles that year. In 1973, Laver won seven titles and successfully participated in the semifinals and final of the Davis Cup, where he won all six of his rubbers for Australia. In 1974 Laver won six titles  from 13 tournaments and ended the year as World No. 4 on the computer. At 36, he was the oldest player during the Open Era to have been included in the year-ending top five.  In 1975, Laver set a record for WCT tournaments by winning four titles and 23 consecutive matches but in 1976, he semi-retired from the main tour, playing only a few selected events. He also signed with World Team Tennis, where he became \"Rookie of the Year\" at the age of 38 but won five tiles  overall that season.  Overall, despite turning 30 just months after the Open Era began, Laver had tremendous success. He won 74 singles titles, which remains fifth most of the era, and his total singles match win rate of over 79% places him in the top 10 of the era. Plus, like most players of his day, he regularly played doubles, winning 37 titles.  Rivalries  Laver had a long-running, friendly rivalry with Ken Rosewall between 1963, when he started out as a pro, and 1976, when both were semi-retired from the main tour. Including tournaments and one-night stands, they played over 130 matches, all of them as professionals, with some results from the barnstorming pro tours lost or badly recorded. Overall a match score of 79–63 in favour of Laver can be documented.  Against the older Pancho Gonzales, whom he played 1964 to 1970 on the pro tour, Laver had a lead of 35–19 or 38–21, depending on the source.  Laver had another, even longer rivalry with his fellow Queenslander Roy Emerson. They met first on the senior amateur tour in 1958 and dominated the amateur circuit until 1962, before Laver turned pro. When open tennis arrived in 1968, Emerson joined the pro tour, and had many new battles with Laver. Overall the score is 49–18 in favour of Laver, with 7–2 in major Grand Slam tournaments.  Laver had also many battles with Lew Hoad in his first years on the pro circuit 1963–1966. Although he lost the first 8 matches in January 1963, Laver later in the year began to turn around their rivalry, and until 1966, he had built a 38–21 lead. Against Arthur Ashe, Laver had a head-to-head lead of 21–3, winning all of the first 18 matches. Ashe\\'s first win came in 1974, when Laver was 35. Another younger rival in the Open Era was John Newcombe, whom Laver led 16–5 in their head-to-head score.  Davis Cup  Laver helped Australia win the Davis Cup four consecutive times from 1959–62. In 1973, professionals were permitted to play in the Davis Cup for the first time, and Laver was on a winning team for the fifth time, claiming two singles and a doubles rubber in the final as Australia beat the United States 5–0. Australia were crowned Davis Cup champions in each of the five seasons Laver played in the competition. Laver won 16 out of 20 Davis Cup singles matches and all four of his doubles.  Place among the all-time great tennis players  The members of the press, notably Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph, issued subjective rankings for amateur players before the start of the Open Era and for all players after the start of that era. Laver was ranked by the press as the World No. 1 player in 1961 and 1962 (as an amateur) and in 1968 and 1969 (as a professional).  According to the article, Bill Tilden was the best player for seven years and Pancho Gonzales for eight years. While Laver was indisputably the best player from 1965 through 1969, the article asserts that Laver had a valid claim for the top spot also for 1964 and 1970.  Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter, ranked Laver only in the \"second echelon\" of great players, just behind the six best.  He writes that although Laver was \"absolutely unbeatable for a year or two late in the 1960s\", a \"careful comparison\" could be made between Laver and the somewhat older Gonzales and that Kramer is \"positive that Gonzales could have beaten Laver regularly.\" Kramer\\'s main argument for downgrading Laver is that, \"Ken Rosewall beat Laver in those two World Championship of Tennis finals and that was a title Laver really wanted.\" Kramer sees as evidence of Gonzales\\' superiority over Laver the fact that Gonzales defeated Laver in a US$10,000 winner-take-all, five-set match before 15,000 spectators in New York City\\'s Madison Square Garden in January 1970, when Gonzales was 41 years old and Laver was still considered the World No. 1 player. On the other hand, Gonzales was still a top ten player when this match took place and Laver subsequently won this event, beating Gonzales in a straight-sets semifinal. Overall, his head-to-head-record with Gonzales was either 35–19 or 38–21 in favour of Laver, depending on the source. Laver was 12–5 against Gonzales during the Open Era, although Gonzales was then in his late thirties.   Many experts disagree with Kramer\\'s assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver as the best of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, \"You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver\\'s the best player of all time.\" Trabert said in January 2008, \"I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he\\'s done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you\\'ve got to say Laver is the best player of all time.\" Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, \"Give him credit? Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [Greatest of All Time] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own.\"  Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), and during the Open Era (18 in 1969).  After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a \"Professional Grand Slam\" by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.  Laver came out on top in various experts polls for the best of all time. In 1986, the US magazine Inside Tennis polled 37 experts, which resulted in a computerised tournament. Laver ranked first on this list ahead of John McEnroe, Don Budge, Kramer, Björn Borg, Gonzales, Tilden, Jimmy Connors, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad. In a poll by the Associated Press in 2000, Laver was voted \"The Male Tennis Player of the Century\", ahead of Pete Sampras, Tilden, Borg, Budge, McEnroe and Hoad (tied), Rosewall and Roy Emerson (tied), and Kramer. In an article in Tennis Week in 2007, the tennis historian Raymond Lee statistically analysed the all-time best players. Laver topped his list ahead of Tilden and Borg (tied), Roger Federer, Gonzales, Rosewall, Budge, Ivan Lendl, Connors, Sampras, McEnroe, and Kramer.  In 1989, Bud Collins wrote, \"I remain unconvinced that there ever was a better player than Rod Laver\".  Thirteen years later, however, as editor of the \"Total Tennis, The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia\", Collins was more guarded. He wrote that Laver would \"be known as possibly the greatest player ever.\" but also said that Gonzales was \"probably as good as anyone who ever played the game, if not better.\"  And Collins called Tilden \"perhaps the greatest player of them all.\"  In an August 2006 article for MSNBC, Collins ranked Laver as one of the five top men\\'s tennis stars of all time, along with Tilden, Gonzales, Borg, and Sampras. He pointed to Tilden\\'s \"phenomenal .938 winning percentage\", said \"If I had to choose someone to play for my life it would be Pancho Gonzalez\", praised Borg\\'s uncanny transition from the French Open to Wimbledon, cited Sampras\\'s \"assault on the citadels of the past\", and called Laver \"in my eyes, the greatest player ever\".   In 1973, the ATP\\'s computer rankings were established. Laver attained his highest ranking on that computer of World No. 3 in 1974. Laver\\'s highest year-end ranking by the ATP was World No. 4 in 1974. Laver semi-retired from the main professional tennis tour in 1975 while still being ranked in the top 10. In terms of yearly prize money won, Laver was the leader from 1964 until 1971.  The number of tournament singles titles that Laver won during his career varies depending on the source. The ATP credits Laver with 46 Open Era titles while \"Total Tennis: The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia\" (edited by Bud Collins), give him 47 or 54 titles during the Open Era alone. Collins credits him with 184 titles in amateur, professional, and open competition, without listing them in detail.  Laver\\'s eleven Grand Slam singles titles currently place him tied with Borg for fifth place on the all-time list. Only Sampras, Emerson, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have won more Grand Slam singles titles. Laver also won eight Major doubles titles. Laver is the only player to have twice won all four Grand Slam singles tournaments during the same calendar year although three of the four Grand Slams were played on grass at the time – the Australian Open, US Open, and Wimbledon.  Because none of the Majors were played on hardcourts in Laver\\'s era, he never won a Grand Slam tournament on that surface. The tennis landscape today is different as half of the year\\'s Majors are played on hardcourts. Only six players have won Major titles on clay, grass and hardcourts: Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are the only players in history to have simultaneously held Grand Slam tournament titles on the three surfaces.  Previous observations change substantially if we also consider professional grand slam majors, which were played on three different surfaces (clay, grass and wood/parquet), and wherein Laver, like Rosewall, excelled. Furthermore, the ATP Performance Zone website lists his (partial) career win/loss percentage on hardcourt as .813, on carpet as .766, on grass as .827 and on clay as .764.  Laver was unable to compete in the Grand Slam tournaments during his professional career between 1963 and 1968 and it is argued he would likely have won more titles had he been able to do so.  Sports columnist Malcolm Knox of the Sydney Morning Herald assesses the effect of Laver\\'s ban on competing in Grand Slams. He states: \"..if grand slams are taken as the benchmark, consider this. Laver won 11 of the 16 grand slam titles he contested in his prime. The pro tour put him out of 20 grand slams from age 23 to 28\". Based on this he puts Laver and Rosewall in \"a class of two\".   Honours  In 1969, Laver was awarded the ABC Sportsman of the Year Award. Laver was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 and upgraded to a Legend of Australian Sport in 2002.  He is also an Australian Living Treasure. In 2000, Centre Court at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne was renamed Rod Laver Arena.  In 2009 Laver was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.  A footbridge in Brisbane, connecting the Yeerongpilly rail station to the Queensland Tennis Centre, was named after him.   Post-retirement  On 27 July 1998, Laver suffered a stroke while being interviewed by ESPN-TV in the United States for their SportsCentury 20th Century sports retrospective series.  He made a good recovery with excellent medical care. In 2000, the centre court at Melbourne Park, which today hosts the Australian Open, was named the Rod Laver Arena in his honour. In 2003, Laver, along with his fellow Australian tennis superstar Margaret Court, was honoured with his portrait on a postage stamp by the \"Australia Post Australian Legends Award\".  Laver returned to his native country to present Roger Federer in 2006, Rafael Nadal in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2012 the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, which is awarded to the Men\\'s Singles winner of the Australian Open. He was present to witness Federer make tennis history at Wimbledon when he beat Pete Sampras\\' record by winning his 15th Grand Slam Title.  Laver resides in Carlsbad, California,  and attends San Diego Chargers games on occasion.   After the short-lived reintroduction of knighthoods in Australia in 2014, there were calls for Laver to be knighted within the Order of Australia. In 2016 Laver was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia, by which time knighthoods had again been abolished and the Companion was the highest honour available in the Order.  Performance timeline  Laver joined the professional tennis circuit in 1963 and as a consequence was banned from competing in the Grand Slams until the start of the Open Era at the 1968 French Open.

Morgan\\'s major roles included Pete Porter in both December Bride (1954–1959) and Pete and Gladys (1960–1962); Officer Bill Gannon on Dragnet (1967–1970); Gunsmoke (11/23/1970)\"The \"Witness; Amos Coogan on Hec Ramsey (1972–1974); and for his starring role as Colonel Sherman T. Potter in M*A*S*H (1975–1983) and AfterMASH (1983–1984). Morgan also appeared in more than 100 films.  Early life and career  Morgan was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1915, the son of Hannah and Henry Bratsberg, who were of Swedish and Norwegian ancestry.   In his interview with the Archive of American Television, Morgan spelled his Norwegian family surname as \"Bratsberg\". Many sources, however, including some family records, list the spelling as \"Bratsburg\". According to one source, when Morgan\\'s father Henry registered at junior high school, \"the registrar spelled it Bratsburg instead of Bratsberg. Bashful Henry did not demur.\"   Morgan was reared in Muskegon, Michigan, and graduated from Muskegon High School in 1933, where he achieved distinction as a statewide debating champion.  He originally aspired to a J.D. degree, but began acting while a junior at the University of Chicago in 1935.  He began acting on stage under his birth name, in 1937, joining the Group Theatre in New York City formed by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg in 1931.   He appeared in the original production of the Clifford Odets play Golden Boy, followed by a host of successful Broadway roles alongside such other Group members as Lee J. Cobb, Elia Kazan, Sanford Meisner, and Karl Malden. Morgan also did summer stock at the Pine Brook Country Club located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut.  Film work  Morgan made his screen debut (originally using the name \"Henry Morgan\") in the 1942 movie To the Shores of Tripoli. His screen name later would become \"Henry \\'Harry\\' Morgan\" and eventually Harry Morgan, to avoid confusion with the popular humorist of the same name.  In the same year, Morgan appeared in the movie Orchestra Wives as a young man pushing his way to the front of a ballroom crowd with his date to hear Glenn Miller\\'s band play. A few years later, still credited as Henry Morgan, he was cast in the role of pianist Chummy MacGregor in the 1954 biopic The Glenn Miller Story.  Morgan continued to play a number of significant roles on the big screen in such films as The Ox-Bow Incident (1943); Wing and a Prayer (1944); Dragonwyck (1946); The Big Clock (1948); High Noon (1952); and several films in the 1950s for director Anthony Mann, including Bend of the River (1952); Thunder Bay (1953); The Glenn Miller Story (1954); The Far Country (1955) and Strategic Air Command (1955). In his later film career, he appeared in Inherit the Wind (1960); How the West Was Won (1962) (as Ulysses S. Grant); John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1965); Frankie and Johnny (1966); Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969); Support Your Local Gunfighter! (1971); Snowball Express (1972); The Shootist (1976); The Wild Wild West Revisited (1979); and as Captain Gannon in the film version of Dragnet (1987) with Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks.  Radio and television  Morgan hosted the NBC radio series Mystery in the Air starring Peter Lorre in 1947. On CBS, he played Pete Porter in Pete and Gladys (1960–1962), with Cara Williams as wife Gladys. Pete and Gladys was a spinoff of December Bride (1954–1959), starring Spring Byington, a show in which Morgan had a popular recurring role.  In 1950, Morgan appeared as an obtrusive, alcohol-addled hotel clerk in the Dragnet radio episode \"The Big Boys\".  1960s: Dragnet and other roles  After Pete and Gladys ended production, Morgan guest starred in the role of Al Everett in the 1962 episode \"Like My Own Brother\" on Gene Kelly\\'s ABC drama series, Going My Way, loosely based on the 1944 Bing Crosby film of the same name. That same year he played the mobster Bugs Moran in an episode of ABC\\'s The Untouchables, with Robert Stack. In 1963, he was cast as Sheriff Ernie Backwater on Richard Boone\\'s Have Gun - Will Travel western series on CBS.  In the 1964–1965 season, Morgan co-starred as Seldom Jackson in the 26-week NBC comedy/drama Kentucky Jones, starring Dennis Weaver, formerly of Gunsmoke.  Morgan is even more widely recognized as Officer Bill Gannon, Joe Friday\\'s partner in the revived version of Dragnet (1967–1970).  Morgan had also appeared with Dragnet star Jack Webb in two film noir movies, Dark City (1950) and Appointment with Danger (1951), and was an early regular member of Jack Webb\\'s stock company of actors on the original Dragnet radio show. Morgan later worked on two other shows for Webb: 1971\\'s The D.A. and the 1972–1974 western series,  Hec Ramsey. Morgan also appeared in at least one episode of Gunsmoke.  1970s: M*A*S*H  Morgan\\'s first appearance on M*A*S*H was in the show\\'s third season (1974–1975), when he played eccentric Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele in \"The General Flipped at Dawn\", which first aired on September 10, 1974.  The following season, Morgan joined the cast of M*A*S*H as Colonel Sherman T. Potter. A fan of the sitcom, Morgan replaced McLean Stevenson, who left the show at the end of the previous season. Unlike Stevenson\\'s character Henry Blake, Potter was a career Army officer who was a firm yet good-humored, caring father figure to those under his command.  In 1980, Morgan won an Emmy award for his performance on M*A*S*H. When asked if he was a better actor after working with the show\\'s talented cast, Morgan responded, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s made me a better human being.\"  After the end of the series, Morgan reprised the Potter role in a short-lived spinoff series, AfterMASH.  Morgan also appeared in several Disney movies throughout the decade, including The Barefoot Executive, Snowball Express, Charley and the Angel, The Apple Dumpling Gang, The Cat from Outer Space (opposite McLean Stevenson) and The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.  Later years  In 1986, he costarred with Hal Linden in Blacke\\'s Magic, a show about a magician who doubled as a detective solving unusual crimes. The series lasted only one season.  Morgan\\'s character, Leonard Blacke, was a semiretired con artist.  In 1987, Morgan reprised his Bill Gannon character, now a captain, for a supporting role in another film version of Dragnet, a parody and homage to the original series written by and starring Dan Aykroyd and co-starring Tom Hanks and Christopher Plummer.  In the 1990s Morgan starred alongside Walter Matthau in a series of television movies for CBS as Stoddard Bell, a judge who is an acquaintance/nemesis/partner of Matthau\\'s Harmon Cobb, an attorney (The Incident;  Against Her Will: An Incident in Baltimore (TV 1992), and Incident in a Small Town (1994 TV)). He also lent his voice to an episode of The Simpsons from season seven, where he once again played Bill Gannon; in the episode \"Mother Simpson\", Gannon and Joe Friday (voiced by Harry Shearer) are FBI agents trying to track down Homer\\'s mother, who is a fugitive from justice.  Morgan also had a recurring role on 3rd Rock from the Sun as Professor Suter, a colleague of Dick Solomon\\'s. Morgan directed episodes for several TV series, including two episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, two episodes of Hec Ramsey, one episode of Adam-12, and eight episodes of M*A*S*H. Morgan had a guest role on The Jeff Foxworthy Show as Raymond and a guest role on Grace Under Fire as Jean\\'s pot-smoking boyfriend.  In 2006, Morgan was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.  Personal life  Morgan\\'s first marriage was to Eileen Detchon from 1940 until her death in 1985. During Morgan\\'s time on M*A*S*H, a photograph of Detchon regularly appeared on the desk of his character.  A drawing of a horse, seen on the wall behind Potter\\'s desk, was drawn by Morgan\\'s grandson, Jeremy Morgan. In addition, Eileen was the name of the wife of Officer Bill Gannon on Dragnet. Morgan had four sons with his first wife: Christopher, Charles, Paul, and Daniel (who died in 1989).  He then married Barbara Bushman Quine (granddaughter of silent film star Francis X. Bushman) on December 17, 1986. The marriage lasted until his death. In July 1997, Morgan was charged with abusing his wife a year earlier, after a beating left her with injuries to her eye, foot, and arm.  Prosecutors dropped the charges after the 82-year-old actor completed a six-month domestic violence counseling program.   Morgan had two siblings, Marguerite and Arnold (both deceased).  Morgan was close friends with bandleader Glenn Miller, whom he met while filming Orchestra Wives in 1942, until Miller\\'s death two years later. Morgan was later cast in the 1954 movie about his friend, The Glenn Miller Story, playing Chummy MacGregor. Morgan\\'s son led the Glenn Miller Orchestra for some years.  Death  Morgan died peacefully in his sleep at 3:00\\xa0a.m. in Los Angeles, on December 7, 2011, at the age of 96.   His son, Charles, said he recently had been treated for pneumonia. His body was cremated and his remains were given to his family.   Following Morgan\\'s death, Mike Farrell, who played B.J. Hunnicutt opposite Morgan in M*A*S*H, released a statement:   Filmography  *To the Shores of Tripoli (1942) *The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe (1942) *Orchestra Wives (1942) *The Omaha Trail (1942) *Crash Dive (1943) *The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) *Happy Land (1943) *The Eve of St. Mark (1944) *Roger Touhy, Gangster (1944) *Wing and a Prayer (1944) *Gentle Annie (1944) *A Bell for Adano (1945) *State Fair (1945) *From This Day Forward (1946) *Johnny Comes Flying Home (1946) *Dragonwyck (1946) *Somewhere in the Night (1946) *It Shouldn\\'t Happen to a Dog (1946) *Crime Doctor\\'s Man Hunt (1946) *The Gangster (1947) *All My Sons (1948) *The Big Clock (1948) *Race Street (1948) *The Saxon Charm (1948) *Moonrise (1948) *Yellow Sky (1948) *Hello Out There (1949) *Down to the Sea in Ships (1949) *The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend (1949) *Madame Bovary (1949) *Strange Bargain (1949) *Red Light (1949) *Holiday Affair (1949) *Outside the Wall (1950) *The Showdown (1950) *Dark City (1950) *Belle Le Grand (1951) *When I Grow Up (1951) *Appointment with Danger (1951) *The Highwayman (1951) *The Well (1951) *The Blue Veil (1951) *Boots Malone (1952) *Scandal Sheet (1952) *Bend of the River (1952) *My Six Convicts (1952) *High Noon (1952) *What Price Glory?

He won the marathon at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials and placed tenth in the Olympic marathon in Beijing. He holds the U.S. record in the half marathon (59:43).  With his half marathon record time, he became the first U.S. runner to break the one-hour barrier in the event.   High school  Hall came on to the running scene as a high school junior.  He graduated from high school in the same year as Dathan Ritzenhein and Alan Webb, behind whom he finished in the 2000 Foot Locker Cross Country Championships.  Hall was the California state cross country champion during his junior and senior seasons at Big Bear High School. He finished third at the Foot Locker Nationals in Orlando during his senior season, and also set the Mt. SAC course record in 2000.   In track, he was the National Scholastic mile champion in his junior season at 4:06.15,  and was the CIF California State Meet champion in the 1600 meter run during his senior season with a state record time of 4:02.62,  and won the state title during his junior season in the 3200 meter run at 8:55.12.   Hall competed at the Peregrine Systems U.S. Open at Stanford in the 1500 meters, running 3:42.70, and at the 2001 USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships.  College  Ryan Hall\\'s college career at Stanford University started with injuries that held him back from the promise he showed in high school. In 2001, Hall won the Murray Keating Invitational in his college debut and finished 76th at the NCAA Men\\'s Cross Country Championships. He red-shirted the 2002 track season. In his sophomore year of cross country, he won the Stanford Invitational and the Notre Dame Invitational. He was named first team all Pac-10 and earned All-American honors with his 37th-place finish at the NCAA Championships. He followed this up with a 3:43.37 1500m best his freshman year of track in 2003. The highlight of his collegiate cross country career came in his junior year in 2003. He was named the Pac-10 Cross Country Athlete of the Year after leading Stanford to the NCAA Championship by finishing 2nd to Colorado\\'s Dathan Ritzenhein. His 2004 track season was cut short due to injury but he did record a best of 13:45 in the 5000, which began Hall\\'s change in distance from the 1500. He came back from injury to finish 26th at the NCAA Championships in 2004 to once again earn All-American status. The breakout that everybody expected from Hall since high school took place in the 2005 track season. He earned his first-ever individual NCAA Championship by winning the 5000 meters in 13:22.32, finishing less than a second ahead of his teammate Ian Dobson in a race where the two runners dominated. He graduated from Stanford with a BA in Sociology.  Professional  Hall has been sponsored by ASICS since 2005.  His coach at the time was Terrence Mahon, a former runner at Villanova University.  In 2006 he won his first national title in the 12K cross-country championships, winning by 27 seconds.  On September 16, 2006, Hall won the Great Cow Harbor 10K in Northport, New York, setting a new course record of 28:22.  Hall\\'s road-running success continued when he broke the U.S. 20k record on October 8, 2006, running 57:54, 48 seconds faster than the previous record run by Abdi Abdirahman in 2005.   On January 14, 2007, Hall won the Aramco Houston Half-Marathon in a time of 59:43,  which makes him the 49th fastest half marathoner in history as of February 2013. The performance also demolished the previous North American record of 1:00:55, set by Mark Curp on September 15, 1985, in Philadelphia.  On April 22, 2007, Hall placed 7th in the Flora London Marathon.  His time of 2:08:24 was the fastest marathon debut by any American, and the fastest marathon ever run by an American-born citizen.   On November 3, 2007, Hall won the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials Marathon in a Trials-record 2:09:02   in New York City, New York. With this win, he, Dathan Ritzenhein, and Brian Sell qualified to run the marathon at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China.   On April 13, 2008, Hall placed 5th in the Flora London Marathon. Hall, 25, competing in only his third marathon, finished in 2:06:17.  The only American to run faster is Morocco-born Khalid Khannouchi, who in 2002 ran 2:05:38 in London and 2:05:56 in Chicago.   Hall was featured on the cover of the September 2008 Runner\\'s World magazine and talks about his \"run for glory\" in the marathon in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  On August 24, 2008, Hall was the second American to cross the finish line the 2008 Men\\'s Olympic Marathon, placing 10th with a time of 2:12:33.  He ran at a much more conservative pace than the lead pack did, and gradually moved from 21st place at the 15k mark up to 10th at the 40\\xa0km mark.  His teammates Dathan Ritzenhein and Brian Sell finished 9th and 22nd, respectively.  Hall was chosen as the 2008 Road Runner of the Year in the Open Male division by the Road Runners Club of America.   On April 20, 2009, Hall participated in the 2009 Boston Marathon, finishing third overall in 2:09:40 behind Deriba Merga of Ethiopia and Daniel Rono of Kenya.  Merga and Rono finished with times of 2:08:42 and 2:09:32, respectively.  He returned to the race in 2010, but only managed fourth place, although his time of 2:08:41 was the fastest ever by an American at Boston.   In 2010, Hall finished fourth in the Boston Marathon, and fourteenth in the Philadelphia Distance Run half marathon.  Due to fatigue, he withdrew from the Chicago Marathon.  In October, Hall left his coach Josh Cox (successor of Terrence Mahon), and the Mammoth Track Club.  He won at the 2010 USA 7 Mile Championships.   Sub-2:05:00 at the 2011 Boston Marathon  On December 16, 2010, Hall announced that he would be running the 2011 Boston Marathon, marking his third consecutive appearance in the race. On April 18, 2011, Hall ran the fastest marathon ever by an American, 2:04:58, to finish fourth. Kenya\\'s Geoffrey Mutai ran 57 seconds under the recognized world record at the time, in winning in 2:03:02, and credited Hall with setting - and maintaining - a fast early pace.  However, this was not an American record, since the Boston course is not eligible for records owing to its point-to-point layout and its elevation drop of greater than 1 m/km; a strong net tailwind (15–20 miles/hr) contributed to the runners\\' remarkable 2011 times.   2012 Olympics and 2013  In January 2012, Hall led at halfway point but finished second behind Meb Keflezighi in the Olympic marathon trials in Houston, Texas with a time of 2:09:30, securing his spot on his second Olympic team.  At the Olympics in London, Hall dropped out of the marathon around the eleven mile mark while he ran this race  with a hamstring injury. After his disappointment at the Olympics, Hall signed up for the New York City Marathon for later that year, but was unable to run it and withdrew from the race   (before it was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy) in September.  In 2013, Hall signed up for the Boston Marathon and the New York City Marathon, but withdrew from both due to injuries.    2014  In April 2014, Hall finished 20th in a time of 2:17:50 at the 2014 Boston Marathon, his first marathon finish since the 2012 Olympic trials.  In September 2014, Hall announced that he was being coached by Jack Daniels. Hall announced that he will be running the Utah Valley Marathon in June 2015 but did not record a finish.   2015  On March 15, 2015 at the Los Angeles Marathon, Hall took the lead at the start running the first mile in 4:42 at near world record pace but dropped out at the halfway point after losing touch with the all-African lead pack at the fifth mile. His wife Sara was competing in her first marathon in the same race.    Since July 2015, Ryan Hall\\'s running volume got restricted to 12 miles per week.   2016  In January, 2016, Hall announced his retirement from racing, citing the harmful effects it has had on his body.  At that time, Hall weighed only 127 lb due to low testosterone.   Aftermath  After retirement, Ryan Hall focused to weightlifting. In April 2016, Ryan Hall gained from 127 lb to 165 lb.

Hall\\'s younger brother Chad won the 2006 Foot Locker National Cross Country Championships, the de facto national championship for high school cross country individual runners. Chad was following in his sister-in-law\\'s footsteps, as Sara Hall (née Bei) won the girl\\'s championships in 2000, the same year Ryan himself finished 3rd. Chad  attended the University of Oregon. In 2008, Chad transferred to University of California, Riverside and graduated in 2012.  In 2009, Ryan and his wife Sara formed the Hall Steps Foundation to empower the running community to use the energy and resources that fuel runners’ athletic achievements for social justice efforts.  Ryan\\'s home town of Big Bear Lake created the \"Move a Million Miles for Ryan Hall\" campaign to support Ryan\\'s quest for 2008 Olympic Marathon gold by collectively logging 1,000,000 exercise miles.
