Document retrieval and answer extraction on [TriviaQA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551).
This project was developed in course of the [IE 691 Information Retrieval and Web Search Project](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/teaching/course-details/courses-for-master-candidates/ie-663-information-retrieval-and-web-search/) together with [@KathPra](https://github.com/KathPra) and [@Miriamgoldilocks](https://github.com/Miriamgoldilocks).

The solution covers the following steps:
1. Document Retrieval with BM25 and VSM
2. Neural reranking of retrieved documents with RoBERTa
3. Answer extraction with multiple BERT variants
